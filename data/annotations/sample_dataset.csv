validation,"I suppose that’s why MIT is not for every student and why it is difficult and costly to get into. This course review requires a special level of mastery of the material, which assumes a great deal of understanding and problem practice throughout the course. When a matrix is not square and doesn’t have a unique solution (independent rows or columns) all kinds of scenarios could happen. Adding to that, whether the matrix is orthogonal, orthonormal, symmetric, positive or semi definite, as well as others involving Eigenvectors, values, pivots and determinants. I suppose that the best way to wrap all that information around the head is to start with some simple 2 by 2 or 3 by 3 matrix and experiment with all different scenarios using a good software package to spit out the output and see how the theory works.

Also, when vectors (1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 5) and (3, 3, 8) are written as column vectors and placed in a 3x3 matrix A, A’s first two rows equal (1, 2, 3).

Hence the rank of A is 2 and its nullity is 3 – 2 = 1 > 0.

Thus A’s columns are linearly dependent.

Let's say p is odd, then we cut <vxy> where x=""1"" and (v, y) has same number of ""0""s in that case it can be pumped, but what if p is even ? then x=""1"" and we are left with (p-1) which clearly cuts in unequal parts for v and y, so the number of zeros in one side (whichever) will be smaller than other side. As I mentioned earlier, since we are proving by contradiction, one example should be sufficient to show the contradiction. Any thoughts, why this wouldn't work ?
