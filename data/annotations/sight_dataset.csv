Let's say p is odd, then we cut <vxy> where x=""1"" and (v, y) has same number of ""0""s in that case it can be pumped, but what if p is even ? then x=""1"" and we are left with (p-1) which clearly cuts in unequal parts for v and y, so the number of zeros in one side (whichever) will be smaller than other side. As I mentioned earlier, since we are proving by contradiction, one example should be sufficient to show the contradiction. Any thoughts, why this wouldn't work ?

Think like this: let p & l be a vector from P & L respectively. than u=p+l belongs to
P U L and u lies within P as p is within P and l is also within P.

Also c*p & c*l belongs to P & L respectively where c is scalar as P&L are subspace. so c*u=(c*p + c*l) belongs to P U L. 

Finally, zero vector lies in both P & L. so Zero vectors belongs to P U L.

If you're watching this video then you know how beneficial MIT OCW is! Donate now! It literally took a minute and was so easy and I'm not someone who can be bothered donating to things normally..

But if like me you've ever had trouble learning something at school/uni or needed extra material or just been keen to learn then you may have benefited from all the great lectures + content MIT OCW provides! So give back a little even if it's just a few dollars and share and convince others to give too. :)

If we want humanity to progress then education is key and it's great to see one of the best universities in the world putting up it's resources to benefit everyone!

Then simplifies to f'(a)*0, this however only holds if a function is continuous. If a function was not continuous then it would simplify to f'(a)*some constant. As f(x) x->a - f(a)=c - is not continuous.

Which would make it not = 0.

So nice that I figured this out when I walk through the previous materials. But still, he managed to show there's a new (to me) point of view to such bijection: pseudo-inverse works as *the* inverse function of the bijection mapping, and that the pseudo-inverse *also eliminates* some (resp. left) null space, just like what the original is doing.

"For me, too many steps were skipped @20:20 . To understand this, it helps to know about elementary matrices. Basically, if you want to add k * row_i1 to row_i2, you can left multiply by m x m matrix I + M where M is all zeros except entry i2,i1 = k. To see why I + M has this effect, do the multiplication ""by hand"" (you can gloss over the effect of I by using the fact that matrix multiplication is distributive). Of course, the inverse of this is I + -M. This is where the 2 in his example comes from: the first (and only) step of elimination was to add -2 * the first row to the second row. So, we must add 2 * the first row to the second, which is the same as left multiplying by [[1, 0], [2, 1]]. Since this is the only elimination step, that ends up being the L matrix in this tiny example. In general, we would have to multiply a whole bunch of these inverse elementary matrices. Fortunately, that multiplication is very easy to do, because all of these elementary matrices are mostly zero, except on the diagonal." or6C4yBk_SY "Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices" "MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning, Spring 2018" 3866.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

"Here's something they didn't quite spell out to me in my Linear Algebra class:

Let E be the product of row operation matrices. Let F be its inverse, FE = I.
Obviously if Ax = b then EAx = Eb (because f(x) = f(y) for all f when x = y).
But also importantly and relevantly if EAx = Eb then Ax = b:
If EAx = Eb then Ax = IAx = (FE)Ax = F(EAx) = F(Eb) = (FE)b = Ib = b.
That is, divide by E (i.e. multiply by F) on both sides to recover Ax = b.

This is the justification for the algorithm: Compute E * [A b] where E is chosen such that solutions x can be read off easily. Solving E*[A b] means x solves EAx = Eb, but then Ax = b.

So the outputs of the algorithm are in fact solutions to Ax = b." 9Q1q7s1jTzU "8. Solving Ax = b: Row Reduced Form R" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 4679.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

Then, he defined some operator overloads so that any iterative algorithm that calculates/approximates f(x) will also calculate f'(x). Is this right? If so, it doesn't seem that Julia would be the only language that you can do this in.

This whole lecture is based on the point-slope equation which is really just the slope formula anyway. 

How do you get slope m?
(y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1) = m --> Slope

Then, get the x's over to the m

y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)  --> point-slope equation
Then, we solve for y,
y = m(x - x_0) + y_0 --> Linearization

"Okay, if anyone is like me who is interested in Linear Algebra and not necessarily Differential Equations, but still wants to understand this lecture for the sake of completeness in this course, here is the list of all the Differential Equations theory you need for this lecture and where you can find content to learn it:

1. Separable differential equations - Khan Academy - this is for v(t)=exp(Lambda t) v(0)
2. 2nd order linear homogeneous equations - Khan Academy - you need this if you want to understand one calculation in the next item on this list (quick to learn anyways)
3. Systems of differential equations - MIT OCW 18.03, lectures 24 and 25 - basically does the first example in this lecture, but actually goes through the steps of explaining what is happening, highly recommended to watch both videos

As someone who is unlikely to apply a whole lot of differential equations in the future, I still found this lecture useful to reinforce the properties of Eigenstuff from the previous lecture, also the very last bit of the lecture is very cool" IZqwi0wJovM "23.

"Timestamps and Summary for Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem

0:00 - Recap of Lecture 2
Last lecture: linear operators between normed vector spaces are continuous if and only if they are bounded. The space of bounded operators between two such NVS's itself forms an NVS, under the operator norm. When the target is a Banach space, this space of bounded operators also becomes Banach: this is a way to identify new Banach spaces from existing ones, by considering all bounded operators into them. 

0:59 - Subspaces
A subspace of a given vector space is internally closed under addition and scaling (linear combinations). Theorem: a subspace W of a Banach space V is itself Banach if and only if it is a closed subspace of V with respect to the metric induced by the norm. Closure amounts to showing that W contains all of its limit points (every convergent sequence in W has its limit in W). We can take any sequence in W; by hypothesis (completeness) it is Cauchy and converges in W. Conversely, if the subspace is closed, we can take a Cauchy sequence in W -- regarding it as a sequence in the ambient Banach space V, it converges to an element in W by closure. This shows every Cauchy sequence in W converges in W, so W is Banach. 

5:14 - Quotient Spaces
Another crucial way to form new spaces from old by passing to substructures involves the process of taking quotients. Given a subspace W of V, introduce (and verify) an equivalence relation on vectors in V by identifying two vectors together if their difference lies in W. This allows us to form the quotient set V/W under that equivalence relation; furthermore, it naturally inherits the operations from V and becomes a vector space in its own right. 

11:31 - From Seminorms to Norms
Recall that a seminorm satisfies homogeneity and the triangle inequality, but not necessarily definiteness -- consider the norm of the derivative of a function; it exhibits the former two properties but resolves to zero on constant functions. Theorem: a seminorm on a vector space descends to a norm on its quotient taken with the subspace of all vectors on which the seminorm is zero. Intuitively: the presence of vectors with seminorm zero represent an ""obstruction"" of the seminorm from becoming a norm. By collapsing the obstruction in the quotient, we obtain a true norm. 

23:11 - Baire Category Theorem
A cornerstone of general topology with vital applications in analysis. The version given here states that if a complete metric space can be expressed as the countable union of closed sets, then at least one of the closed sets contains an open ball (eq. has an interior point/nonempty interior). It can be reformulated to state that the countable intersection of open, dense sets in a complete metric space remains dense. (Note: a second result, not as relevant to functional analysis, states that the same holds true for locally compact regular spaces. This is especially important in the study of locally compact Hausdorff spaces. The version proven here requires some form of the Axiom of Choice; over ZF it turns out equivalent to a weaker form of Choice that is sufficient to build up most of real analysis). 

50:39 - The Uniform Boundedness Theorem
Our first major functional analysis result: it states that a sequence of pointwise-bounded operators on a Banach space is also bounded uniformly. More precisely, a sequence of linear operators from a Banach space to a normed vector space is bounded uniformly in the operator norm as soon as each individual operator is bounded. By showing that each of these operators have bounds that might vary with each point, this theorem claims that a bound can be chosen for all operators in the sequence that is independent of the point, and can be applied globally." 58B5dEJReQ8 "Lecture 3: Quotient Spaces, the Baire Category Theorem and the Uniform Boundedness Theorem" "MIT 18.102 Introduction to Functional Analysis, Spring 2021" 11015.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

"For those confused by this lecture, don't worry, you should be, it's no a failure of yours, it's a syllabus description mistake.

I'm happy I see these videos as a review for things I ALREADY LEARNED years ago, because obviously if I were first exposed to this lecture with the prerequisites the course mentions, it wouldn't have been possible to understand this lecture.

While the course specifies 18.02 as a prereq, and then immediately dismisses in its syllabus as not important, this lecture requires both 18.02 and 18.03, the latter is not mentioned at all in the syllabus.  Universities usually parallelize these kind of courses with the parallel requisites such as 18.03, but OCW does not hint that at their site or here.

While for me it was nice, I recognize that if you don't know diff. eqs this would not be possible for you to learn.

Having this variance, we can derive the variance of X_bar, which is var(X_bar) = var([X1+...+Xn]/n), know properties of variance, we take n out, as var(X_bar) = 1/n^2 * var(X1+...+Xn), since i.i.d., these xi all have the same variance, therefore we have n*var(xi) divided by n^2, so the variance(X_bar) = var(Xi)/n, so to standardize it (in CTL), we divide it by the square root of var(Xi)/n, which is what he wrote on the board.

"Summary of this class , Since so many on comments are confused ->
Target -> Solve Ax=b / Ax=kx / Au=kv When A is big matrix.
**1)Finding Eigenvalues of Big Matrix ->
QR process ==> A0 -> Q0R0 , A1(SImilar to A0) ->R0Q0 = Q1R1 , A2 -> R1Q1=Q2R2 And Go on ultill we have a Upper Triangular Matrix 
QR process on original matrix will be expensive .First take the matrix to Hessenberg Form and then do QR process.
Take the Matrix A to Hessenberg form H using Arnoldi Iteration.
If The Matrix A is S(symmetric) Then , the hessenberg form will be tridiagonal And even easier to compute .

**2) Finding SVD ->
a)Find Q1 And Q2 such that Q1*A*Q2 becomes bidiagonal (The SIngular values will remain same since its unitary invariant)
b)Use some QR kind of method to find SVD from the bidiagonal Matrix 

**3)Solving Ax=b (Not on lecture but on Notes) ->
a)Use GMRES and get a answer on Krylov space
b)Use Conjugate Gradient if The Matrix A is Positive Definate" d32WV1rKoVk "12. Computing Eigenvalues and Singular Values" "MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning, Spring 2018" 8954.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

"I don't see what's so good about Gilbert Strang. I'm only able to learn and understand part of the content with him and so much of it I can't keep track of it.

I forget what is an invertible matrix, he always seems to just say this is invertible by just looking at it, and I can't see it by just looking at it, so that makes that hard to follow.


I can't keep track of what has n, n - r, m - r, all that gets jumbled up in my mind.


He wants me to go through steps with him, and sometimes I don't even know where's going with it, so I can't, I have to wait to see what he does, probably because he hasn't shown the steps first along with why they work, so that it never synched in my brain to begin with.

Occasionally I am able to answer a question right when he asks, but half the time, I'm only half following, if even that.

I don't see why other people think his teaching style is so amazing, it's so scattered, and doesn't clearly show how & why things work before expecting me to follow along with examples.

Though I think I'm pretty good at doing elimination.

I definitely can't multiply matrixes so fast as he does, I need to pause the video, and actually write down my work on paper, he just skips steps and writes them down.

Like I don't get it, his style is just way off for me, do I just learn differently then most people?, like I don't get it." l88D4r74gtM "13. Quiz 1 Review" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 5330.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

"When talking about continuous random variables don't use the word random because there is nothing random about the distribution of the outcomes of these particular variables due to the nature of the samples being analyzed. Unfortunately this seems to be a misleading concept throughout almost all the videos on the internet regarding this subject. Even discrete random variables shouldn't initially be considered random due to the uncertainty of their distribution outcome. Uncertainty and randomness do not have the same meaning. An uncertain discrete variable could prove to be more likely random in it's outcome according to a more likely random type distribution.   When analyzing continuous variable distributions you're are admitting the existence of a value range (similar to a discrete distribution), but contrary to a discrete distribution you are also admitting that, without any trials and without knowing the outcome, that you are going to have a certain type of distribution that follows a certain type of symmetrical curve. As the values tend to get further from the peak of the curve their frequency starts to decrease more or less proportionally. It's almost like a rule that you follow. Being that the uncertainty lies only in the variance of the distribution. Normally dealing with continuous distributions you are analyzing co-related values (correlation between a infinite value and it's frequency), who's relationship is given through a formula. The problem is that there are no predefined rules, formulas or predefined co-relations for uncertain outcomes. Notice that I used the word uncertain and not random." 3MOahpLxj6A "5.

"@joaopp3
Yes, some lecturers become so used to their courses that they start to forget what it is that is considered difficult by new students, and stupidly assume that ""everyone"" ""just knows"" what all math symbols and proofs mean.
In my opinion, the best way to teach a new concept is to give a quick summary of what it is going to be about and then give a lot of examples, and encourage the students to help solving them.
That's exactly what professor Strang always does, and that's one of the reasons why he is so amazing.

I also think that it is very important that a lecturer shows a genuine fascination for the subject, and is always willing to help the students and respects that some of them may have a harder time than others with certain parts;
and it is also a huge plus if the lecturer has a sense of humour and presents the lecturers in a relaxed way.

or yet that you can factor a scalar out of a row in a way that

"@ 26:04 I have to admit, that took me a second to figure it out. 
Prof Strang didn't actually have anything wrong, he just couldn't see while in the middle of it why that was the case. He actually had it at 26:44 but let it slip through his hands.
For that you have to go back to when he was computing matrix ""V"".  The evec associated with eval of 18 was [1;-1] but it also can be written as [-1;1]

He chose the [1;-1] which had the effect once we made it to the final calculation of U * Diag^2 * V^t that it SWAPPED THE COLUMNS of A
His original A was [4,4;-3,3] and the calc'd one was [4,4;3,-3]
Had he chosen the 'other version' of the evec associated with Lambda = 18 when figuring out ""V"", he would have gotten back the same ""A"" he started with instead of the column-swapped version.

Then I decided to do it this summer. Hats off to Professor Auroux, he teaches so smoothly never during the entire course I felt like once I feared it.

"41:52 -- LOL  (I'm officially a math-geek.  Then again, it's a calm, late-summertime Saturday Morning high in the Rocky Mountains and I'm watching this.  The conclusion was a bit forgone.)  Regrettably, way back in the day,  my fundamental default position was that all concepts were derivative and that prior to use their source must be known.  Here's how I wish a trusted mentor would have advised me regarding Linear Algebra in my third college semester: ""The core things of linear algebra have been completely made-up and have only subsequently been discovered to have very interesting properties and to be extremely powerful (but only under certain conditions.)  Linear is mostly a short-hand notation for some stuff with which you are already familiar -- systems of linear equations. (Demanding to know the legitimacy of this new symbology is nonsensical.  It's very much equivalent to demanding to know why the utterance 'dog' is used to express the concept of a canine.  Worse -- it's like trying to derive the significance of the 'og' part of that particulate word.)  The core things of linear algebra are merely tools -- or better yet: heavy machinery.  They allow mathematical professionals (of the type you seem to aspire to be)  to 'move around', or to think in broad terms, about vast quantities of calculations that you have become expert at doing manually.  As with any scientific concept, their perfection is provisional.  Rest assured though, that they have been studied extensively for many centuries.  What they're good for, how they can be worked with, and where they fail are are all reasonably well known (as an example from today: Associative works; Commutative does not.)  Many people find linear algebra very useful.   Now, before this get's out of hand, let me first say that you are absolutely not 'many people.'  Further, I fully understand that trust and acceptance and taking-the-easy-way-out and group-think all scare the livin'-be-jesus out of ya. So I'm not asking that trust me and study linear because I know that it's right (we've already established that I don't), nor that you go-along-to-get-along, nor that you buckle down and learn this because it's what everyone else is doing.  What I'm offering here, for your consideration, is that the baubles you'll pick up from mastering linear will likely give you a really nice view of the mathematical world -- and I'm pretty sure you'll like that.  Have fun!"""

"For BPP, deep learning and for the general structure of neural networks the following comments may be useful. 

To begin with, note that instead of partial derivatives one can work with derivatives as the linear transformations they really are. 

It is also possible to look at the networks in a more structured manner. The basic ideas of BPP can then be applied in much more general cases. Several steps are involved. 

1.- More general processing units. 
Any continuously differentiable function of inputs and weights will do; these inputs and weights can belong, beyond Euclidean spaces, to any Hilbert space. Derivatives are linear transformations and the derivative of a neural processing unit is the direct sum of its partial derivatives with respect to the inputs and with respect to the weights; this is a linear transformation expressed as the sum of its restrictions to a pair of complementary subspaces. 

2.- More general layers (any number of units). 
Single unit layers can create a bottleneck that renders the whole network useless. Putting together several units in a unique layer is equivalent to taking their product (as functions, in the sense of set theory). The layers are functions of the of inputs and of the weights of the totality of the units. The derivative of a layer is then the product of the derivatives of the units; this is a product of linear transformations. 

3.- Networks with any number of layers. 
A network is the composition (as functions, and in the set theoretical sense) of its layers. By the chain rule the derivative of the network is the composition of the derivatives of the layers; this is a composition of linear transformations. 

4.- Quadratic error of a function. 
...
——-
Since this comment is becoming too long I will stop here. The point is that a very general viewpoint clarifies many aspects of BPP. 

If you are interested in the full story and have some familiarity with Hilbert spaces please google for papers dealing with backpropagation in Hilbert spaces. A related article with matrix formulas for backpropagation on semilinear networks is also available. 

For a glimpse into a completely new deep learning algorithm which is orders of magnitude more efficient, controllable and faster than BPP search in this platform for a video about deep learning without backpropagation; in its description there are links to a demo software. 

The new algorithm is based on the following very general and powerful result (google it): Polyhedrons and perceptrons are functionally equivalent. 

For the elementary conceptual basis of NNs see the article Neural Network Formalism.

"First of all, thank you so much for this clear and lucid presentation of the material. At 7:30, when Dr. Rodriguez illustrates the example of the complement of an open ball in R^2, he states that the set is neither closed nor convex -- I believe he meant to say that it is only non-convex (it would be closed by definition, as the complement of an open set in the usual metric topology) which would demonstrate the necessity of convexity; the minimum norm occurs across the boundary of the disk. If it were both closed and convex as a counterexample, we couldn't conclude that either property was necessary for the length-minimization property to hold. To show that being closed is also needed, we could also (in addition to Dr. Rodriguez's second example) take an open ball not centered at the origin: a unique minimum-norm element (some point closest to zero) would occur on its boundary, which the ball does not contain because that is its set of limit points."

"Is there a way for us to check the notes he is referring at 51:05 ?


Here is what i understood from this lecture:


1.We want to take a sample of a matrix multiplication. Recalling that a matrix multiplication is a sum of columns by rows, we choose the index randomly and get the corresponding rank 1 matrix.


2. We also want that this method converges to AB if we take the mean of different samples, which means that the expected value of this rank 1 sampling is AB. This will force us to rescale the sample by 1/pj.


3.Knowing this, we conclude that taking the rank1 sample of a matrix means taking (1/pj)*(aj*bj). Sampling isnt just about choosing a random index j, but rescaling the rank 1 matrix aj*bj.


4. We dont want pj to be arbitrary, we want it to be optimum in some way, the criteria he used was to choose the pj that minimizes the variance of the norm of the rank 1 sample. This variance is a number and not a matrix since its the variance of a norm.


5. Here comes the procedure he showed which is finding the formula of that variance and then apply langrange multiplier method.


However, i cant explain the presence of the ""s"" variable and the magical appereance of the Frobenius norm at 35:01


Although i can´t explain them, they should be there because otherwise, with that specific optimum pj, variance of norm turns to be zero, and i have the feeling that a zero variance is not a good conclusion.

"How I understood the beginning example about the mean: We defined our sample space to be Omega = { [a,0] , [0,b] }. We defined the distribution over this sample space to be uniform (hence the 1/2). Now each sample can be seen as a random variable which takes on one of the values in Omega. By definition, the expectation is the sum of the products of each outcome with its probability. However, if we define a random variable to be the sum of the samples then we get the expectation of the new random variable is sum of the expectations of each sample. Each sample has the same expectation thus we can reduce the sum to a multiplication by s.

"OK. This stuff is highly confusing, to say the least. As much as one could rather easily understand what a mean of a random matrix is, it's not that simple with variance. Variance is defined for a random variable or a vector. For a simple r.v. that has its values in R^1, it's just the expectation of (X-E(X))^2, that is E[(X - EX)^2]. For a vector that has its values in R^n it's a COVARIANCE MATRIX. Now, what would be the variance of a matrix? I've never heard of such a construct and I've studied maths (specialization: probability and stats) for 5 years at a technical uni. Maybe (and it's a guess) he wants to do this: Take the random element (which is a random matrix with a probability measure picking up a certain matrix out of a set with a probability of p_i, i=1...n, where n is the number of columns in A and rows in B, since we want to sample from all the columns of A, not only some r cols) and subtract from it the ""mean element"" (the mean of the matrices as calculated), then take the norm of this subtraction (which is a norm of a matrix), square it and multiply by the probability of the element selected. Then sum up over all the elements (sum over the matrices/elements or columns of A, which is the same as there's 1-to-1 correspondence between the cols of A and the set of matrices we're selecting from). So, this would give us the mean square distance of a random element from the ""mean element."" The distance would be the 2-norm or the Frobenius norm of a matrix/element. But this would be the EXPECTATION of the random function X : M -> R+ (a random map from the set of matrices/elements to R+ where X(*) = || * - EM ||^2, this being the square of the 2-norm of the element/matrix and EM = ""the mean matrix"", that is AB). So we are calculating the mean of the X mapping but this ""variance "" (as he calls it) is not some kind of ""matrix variance"" (as such things do not exist) but the expectation of the mapping as above. I can't explain what he's trying to do in a better way. He wants to minimize the expected squared distance from the randomly selected matrix to the ""mean matrix."" and hence he looks for a probability distribution on the columns of A that achieves that. At the same time, I don't understand the notation he's trying to use :( Highly confusing, prof.

If I recall correctly, Eckart married the widow of von Neumann. And ended up at UCSD. He was very renowned in applied physics including oceanographicy/ geophysics.

Since eigenvectors and eigenvalues change the magnitude of the parameter vector only, the idea of employing the Eigen transformation concept is quite genius.

"What a gem of a teacher! A legend. I did not learn C of calculus in 5 years of my engineering studies way back in 1974-79. Then came the blessing in disguise and by the way I had to teach some calculus to my daughter in her graduate course in economics. And that is how I landed onto Professor Gilbert Strang's video and I fell in love with calculus which all these years was kind of a terror to me. What a beautiful and stylish way of teaching mathematics. I never have seen any teacher with such a vast knowledge and at the same time  comfortable teaching beginners. God bless Professor Strang with health a d happiness.

"@44:15 initially the formula is op=<a*theta-a*sin(theta),a-a*cos(theta)>
but then let 
a=radius 
a=1
op=<theta-sin(theta),1-cos(theta)>

x(theta)=theta-sin(theta)
y(theta)=1-cos(theta)

so here he parametrise the equation differently than before..

before when it was linear system

we can just use  formula 
Q(t)=InitialQ+t*(EndQ-InitialQ)
so if we have 
InitialQ=<1,2,3>
EndQ=<3,1,2>

we get 
x(t)=1+2t
y(t)=2-t
z(t)=3-t

The base 'e' initially defined at 14:15 was never referred to as natural number, and it was only supposed be some base for which the derivative of e^x is e^x because its slope at x=0 is assumed to be 1. This was never proved. Later on (at 24:30) it was just stated as a fact that e, the natural number, is really that base and that its slope at x=0 is 1.

No matter where you're educated, the initial lectures have to cater for a spectrum of ability. There will be people doing this as a requirement for their major which has no connection to hard science. Social science subjects need a grounding in this. The critics either never made it to college or are too young to know how the system works.

"he makes a comment in passing about doctors ""getting tests results wrong"", but his example about the radar doesn't readily translate into an example about medical testing. Even though a disease might be very rare, doctors don't just order a test for diseases at random. Drs order tests for a disease when a person has symptoms similar to those of others who have previously had the same disease. And so, even though celiac disease is suffered by less than 2% of the population, a patient for which celiac disease testing has been ordered will actually have a much higher chance of having it than a randomly chosen individual. While he's right the a priori chance of a random person having some rare disease is low, that same chance is much higher for a person that has been seen by a doctor and judged to be having symptoms of such rare disease."

"Few comments:-
(1) As a mathematician I never referred to sign change in a function when taking derivative order two as concave up or down - the way I learned and always described to other people was as concave or convex function.

(2) At minuet 44:00, I noticed in few occasions saying the range of the function instead of domain when the intervals were written on the black board. Furthermore 0 < x < e^2 is the same as 0 < x < e and hence the confusion later on with points of inflection when in fact it should have been said that: in the interval 0 < x < e (subset of the entire domain) the function is decreasing since df^2 is less than zero and then from e < x < +infinity, the function is increasing since df^2 is greater than zero.

I studied chemistry at university few years ago, and that definition of Markov Chains really makes me think of what we did with the equilibrium of the reactions with the different molecules.

Actually during the lecture I was trying to guess just from the diagram what the equilibrium would be hahaha.



I feel sad that we were not even given a mention about markov chains back then.

"26:37 this is for those who did not understand the first reasoning behind why the inverse was not possible.
A=[1 3;2 6]  
X is supposed to be the identity matrix so that A^-1A=I
You can approach it this way:
A*(1st col. of X)= [1;0]
which is same as 
1st col. of A* X11+ 2nd col of A*X12
but the problem is that since the first column and second column of A are dependent vectors (that is [1;2] and [2,6] differ only in length and not in the direction. It's impossible that a linear combination of them can result in a vector that has a different slope (as is [1;0])

""Do I have a subspace if I take all the vectors on the plane and all the ones on the line? No.""
False. In general you don't have a subspace, but it depends, sometimes you have one.
The correct answer would be ""If the plane contains the line yes, otherwise no"", another correct answer would be ""in general no"".

If both the objective f and the constraint function g are smooth, the constrained min/max must also occur at some critical points (if we extend its definition a little), as indicated by some directional 0 derivative.

"Years ago I decided to study Linear Algebra. I done a Cert in Engineering and we hadn't done many matrices or enough. So I was really struggling. But I passed as I used the formulae (the course book I had was for Stage 2 and I should really have being Stage 1. But for all that time, out of curiosity I wanted to know what they actually were. I couldn't easily see then how they were vectors. The lecturer makes it clear. I could follow up to finding the eigenvalues. I had always been puzzled how they ignored the other numbers not on the diagonal. Trying an identity as he had and changing the numbers I realised what that diagonal - the trace he called it - was. Amazing! I realized that the 3  1 / 1  3  was 3 x  1 1 /  1 1   It doesn't change except in the amount, not the direction.

"In 25:50 , An alternative way to understand that matrix A doesn't have an Inverse is to visualize the matrix in a cartesian plane. 
The matrix is composed of two vectors: (1,2) & (3,6). Plotting these two vectors you will realize that they are parallel. Thus, they don't create a 2D area. They are a 1D line, one on top of the other. Reversing such vectors (applying the inverse matrix) would result in a  zero-D point, specifically (0,0). Thus, there is no inverse matrix for matrix A. 

Note: Finding that the determinant of the matrix A is equal to 0 would quickly depict this same process." FX4C-JpTFgY "3. Multiplication and Inverse Matrices" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 6596.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

"1) I think strictly speaking the likelihood function (at 15:45) which we need to maximize is the joint density function of the W vector, not the joint density function of the Y vector. The notation and the wording are kind of confused there. But the idea is clear. 2) The parabola/model around 28:45 is first called a quadratic model, then it's explained that it's still a linear model (at 29:50). I assume the term quadratic refers to the X, while the linearity refers to the thetas. 3) I think it should be noted that by introducing h(x) (at 29:57) we get more free parameters (apart from theta0 and theta1) e.g. if h(x) = a . x . x + b . x + c we get also a,b,c as free parameters. So the minimization now happens not just over theta0 and theta1 but also over a,b,c. And that's what might lead to overfitting (the presence of too many free parameters). Right?

"I struggled for the longest time with the discussion around 40:39 about ""how many cases"" there are. I believe what confused me was the instructor (who is excellent) started an approach with conditional probabilities, and then changed back to an approach with counting. (""If you're told that the first two are heads"" sounds like a description of a conditional probability on HH in the first two spots, when we're really conditioned on ""3 H total."") What I _think_ he means is that he's counting every instance in which HH are the first two options. The ""the only uncertainty"" phrase leads you , again, to think he's going to talk about probabilities. However, he seems to mean something more along the lines of ""there are 8 cases where the first two of the three Hs are at the start, namely one case for placing the remaining H in each of the eight remaining positions in the list.""

"At 14:00 that’s *not* true in general. The number of basis vectors of C(A) is rank(A) *yes* but said basis vectors are not the pivot columns. The professor probably misspoke or something.

Doing rref(A) of a matrix means we’re taking linear combinations of the rows of A, so there’s no reason to believe the column space will be preserved during the row-reduction operations. In general, C(A) is not equal to C(rref(A)).

Let A^T stand for transpose of matrix A. Then the following is always true: *C(A) = C( ( rref(A^T) )^T )* . He’s kind of implied this already in previous lectures without using the rote notation, I’m just connecting the dots like a game.

Edit:

A simple example is A = [1,2; 2,4]. rref(A) = [1,2; 0,0]. The column space of rref(A) is along the “y” axis whereas the column space of A is along the line “y” = 2 ”x”. It should be clear that aside from the zero vector, they have no other vectors in common. Further, rref(A) has one pivot column, so the dimension of A should be 1. 2*[1;2] = [2;4] (columns are linearly dependent, so we really only have *1* vector to scale. Hence, dimension of C(A) = r = 1, as earlier predicted 😊

Hopefully this helps someone. Professor Strang is one of the best educators out there, I see why people admire MIT! This playlist in linear algebra is the perfect way to prepare for the vectorized implementations of machine learning (if you actually wanna understand what you’re doing, that is).

"For 13 minutes (21:00-34:30), Professor Jerison tries to justify (1-cos x)/x goes to zero, without, I think, making the case. While he convinces me that the ""1-cosx gap"" goes to zero faster than the arc length, he doesn't show that it goes to zero fast enough. For example, if it went to zero 10 times faster than the arc length, the limit would approach 1/10, not zero. 

I'm comfortable with his argument about (sinx)/x going to 1 and have in fact used that argument to defend the ""small angle"" approximation in Physics. (Larson 3rd edition, pg. 81 however, gives a rigorous explanation using limiting cases of  triangular areas bounding the section of the circular area swept out by the angle, and then applying the squeeze theorem, (1-cosx)/x is left as an exercise. 

But once you have the limit of (sinx)/x going to 1, just multiply top and bottom of (1-cosx)/x by (1+cos), the numerator becomes (sinx)^2  and the expression becomes: 
[(sinx)/x] [(sinx)/(1+cosx)], first factor goes to 1 and the second to zero. It's good to review properties of limits for this.

Where fault can be found, the good is often ignored. MIT and the professors involved are doing a GREAT public service by constructing these online courses. I'm amazed at the breadth and complexity of the courses offered. I deeply thank all of the MIT people involved in this. The examples and problems done in the class are excellent. I find many of the proofs easier to follow than in some texts.

"Well, this lecture is hard for me to understand, it confuses me. But I'm trying to see the big picture. Here's what I think:
The whole lecture is about how to use iteration methods to solve Ax=b, Ax=λx, Av=σu. Since for large matrix, it will cost a lot if we try to solve things like det(A-λI)=0 or do multiplication A*A.T,  we need to use iteration to solve it fast. And in the lecture, several iteration methods are mentioned: Arnoldi iteration, Lanczos iteration, and QR iteration. But I  do not understand many details in these algorithms, and I think I don't need it now, so I will leave these questions to the future." d32WV1rKoVk "12.

That's done because you are estimating population mean via sample mean, and because of that you will underestimate the population variance.

"guys, for the triangle doubt, people are confusing this with fx,y = 1/lx.
its not that, it's the distribution of y and x.
which means 0 <= y <= x <= l.
suppose if both y and x were to only go till l, then it would look like a square with length l. But now since y cannot be greater then x, we remove that upper half of triangle where y was greater than x and hence our triangle comes in the picture. It tells us the possible values of y when x goes from 0 to L. If we want a joint pdf of x and y, it just only depends on x. Here joint pdf = 1/lx . where we just put the value of given x.
Now, we have fx = 1/l and fx,y = 1/lx. We need to find the marginal pdf of y, which is the integration which results to log(l/y) / l  .
Now we have all three of them and can find whatever we want like  expectation and all." CadZXGNauY0 "9. Multiple Continuous Random Variables" "6.041 Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability" 13028.0 0.0 1.0 1.0

However for  (1 - cos θ) / θ, where the horizontal distance from origin to the cord is cos θ.

"For those confused like me regarding the fishing example:
for part d): The number of fish caught can be found in 2 ways
Consider 3 Random Variables:
F: No. of fish caught
T: Time (The values that time can take)
FishTime: FishingTime (The values that fishing time takes, note that this is different from Time r.v.)

1) E[F] = E[F|0<T<2] * P(0<T<2) + E[F|T>2] * P(T>2)
                (0.6*2)       * 1               + 1              * P(0,2)
 

2) E[F] = E[F|FishTime=2] * P(FishTime = 2) + E[F|FishTime>2] * P(FishTime>2)
                E       * (1-P(0,2))               + 1              * P(0,2)
Here E will not be = lambda * tau
This is because if he fishes for exactly 2 hours it means he will definitely not catch 0 fish.
So we need to calculate the conditional pmf. That is P(catches k fish|catches atleast 1 fish)
Then use this to find the new Expected value by multiplying with k and summing for k = 1, 2....
Then put this for E and calculate.

OK I figured out the 36:50 part. It is the spectral theorem which sir had covered in previous class. S = Q (lambda) Q-1. 
Lambda = Q-1 S Q. As, lambda is defined as the matrix of eigen values of S, this implies that S and Q-1 S Q are similar.

"I'm afraid this video doesn't seem to provide any proof of the significant theorem on the blackboard which insists:
=========================
  N((A*)A)=N(A), i.e., the nullspace of (A*)A is identical to that of A, 
where A* denotes the transpose matrix of A. 
(For convenience, let * substitute for the conventional superscript T meaning ""transpose"".)
  ========================
I'd prove it my way, at least for all real number matrices A and real number input vectors, like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof.   Let A be a m-by-n real number matrix.  And then, for any input vector x in R^n
  Ax=0　⇒  ((A*)A)x = (A*)(Ax) =0,
so that if x is in the nullspace of A, then it is also in the nullspace of (A*)A, that is,
  N((A*)A)⊇N(A) ...(1).

On the other hand, let
  a[1], ..., a[n]
 be the column vectors of A.   In other words, let
  a*[1], ..., a*[n] 
be the row vectors of A*.   And then, for any input vector x in R^n, for each of i=1, ..., n, the i-th component of the product vector
  ((A*)A)x=(A*)(Ax)
is the dot product a*[i](Ax).   Therefore, ((A*)A)x=0 implies that for each of i=1, ..., n
  a*[i](Ax)=0,
so that Ax is perpendicular to any linear combination of the column vectors a[1], ..., a[n], i.e., to every vector in the column space C(A) of A.   However, as a linear combination of column vectors
  a[1], ..., a[n],
Ax is also in the column space C(A), which combined with the previous statement means that Ax is in C(A) and at the same time orthogonal to C(A).  This is possible if and only if Ax=0, because otherwise Ax is not perpendicular to itself (see note at the bottom for another reason).   

Thus, after all it has been found that, for any input vector x in R^n
  ((A*)A)x=0 ⇒ Ax=0, 
so that if x is in the nullspace of (A*)A, then it is also in the nullspace of A, that is,
  N((A*)A)⊆N(A) ...(2).

(1) and (2) combined, implication is that N((A*)A)=N(A).　QED.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Note):  If C(A) = {0}, then trivially Ax in C(A) is the zero vector.   Otherwise, by the so-called Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization, an orthonormal basis can be chosen for the column space C(A) such that all the basis vectors are normalized and mutually orthogonal.  Then, the vector Ax in C(A) may be expressed as a linear combination of those basis vectors, namely
  Ax = s[1]n[1]+ ... + s[r]n[r],
where
  n[1], ..., n[r]
are the orthonormal basis vectors, 
  s[1], ..., s[r]
are real numbers, and
  r=rank(A). 
However, since being orthogonal to C(A), Ax is perpendicular to each of the basis vectors.  Thus, for each of k=1, ..., r
  0 = n*[k](Ax)
    = n*[k](s[1]n[1] + ... + s[r]n[r])
    = s[1](n*[k]n[1]) + ... + s[k](n*[k]n[k]) + ... + s[r](n*[k]n[r])
    = s[k], 
implying that Ax = 0.  QED.

"I've been taking proper notes, doing the readings, and all the things you would expect of a student (short of taking the quizzes and final). I'm surprised at myself for having the will, interest, and sustained performance to get here. I'm tooting my own horn because I think I deserve it. Thanks to Professor Strang, I haven't just learned one of the most beautiful frameworks in mathematics. I have also proven that I can focus and get things done. If you knew me, you'd know that I'm unreliable, highly motivated at first, but that I ultimately lose steam and perform poorly. This class taught me that when I choose to do something to completion, and mean it, good things can happen. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Professor G. Strang! Seriously, I'll always hold you in high regard. You gave me the MIT experience. You made me really wanna roll up my sleeves and learn deeply, learn how to think, which is impressive because I'm a college dropout who wanted nothing to do with education (well, schooling, you come across that line of reasoning, I'm sure). This course has improved my confidence. I just wanted to let you know, the special touch you placed on every lecture was precisely what I needed to start to see education in a whole new light.

"The proof for (uv)' should be simpler: 
(u+Δu)(v+Δv) - uv = uv + uΔv + vΔu + ΔuΔv - uv = uΔv + vΔu + ΔuΔv. 
Dividing by Δx and taking the limit as x→0, we instantly obtain:
uv' + vu' + u' x 0 = uv' + vu'. It's more logical that way, and we can clearly see why the formula looks the way it does.

We can of course make the process lengthier by writing instead of Δu and Δv their full expressions: 
u(x+Δx) - u(x) for Δu and  v(x+Δx) - v(x) for Δv. By doing so we get:
(u+Δu)((v+Δv) - uv = [ u(x) + (u(x+Δx) - u(x)) ] [ v(x) + (v(x+Δx) - v(x)) ] - u(x) v(x). And the proof will take more space, while it is still gonna be exactly the same as the two-line proof I have written above. In fact I believe students should practice both writing the short proof and the longer version just to clarify things for themselves. 

Now then, by knowing the end formula (uv' + vu'), we of course can prove it as in this video by trying some adding and subtracting tricks to make the end formula uv' + vu'. That's mathematically correct but it conceals from you why the formula looks the way it does.  *That said, the lectures are otherwise superb and deserve kudos in my opinion and a huge like.*" 4sTKcvYMNxk "Lec 4 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007" "MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006" 10256.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

"Have a small doubt,
Can anyone please resolve this.
As sir said that if we take 2 columns in matrix then sir got a plane as a subspace ..It means if we take the linear combinations of 2 columns then we get a 2-d plane which passes through the origin right?
And now I tried with 2*2 matrix taking 2-d vectors and I should get a line which passes through origin if we take linear combinations of those ..

"It's a little more into matrix theory than that. He's assuming that we've already done the elimination process, and if there were any repeated equation while eliminating, it would yield an entire row of just 0's -that is, no pivot. So in essence saying that there's no pivot in one of the columns is the same as saying that one of the equations was repeated. The rank, r, is the number of pivots, m the number of rows. So if r<m, there must be a column without pivots, and the solution is not unique." RWvi4Vx4CDc "34. Final Course Review" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 7021.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

A few years later I followed the one of Stephen Boyd on Linear Dynamical Systems (and recently part of the one in Convex optimization). These resources have been fundamental in me becoming a well-earning professional that still enjoys learning. Now, when I interview young people for Junior Data Science positions, almost all of them put the cart before the horse, just interested in the trying the latest method, even though they really don't understand what it does. I try to recommend them to follow the same path (start from the basics, follow good-old video lectures) but most of the times this advice is received as an eccentricity: ""Linear Algebra is soooo far away from the cool stuff, man"".

"I love prof. Strang and I'm very grateful for his lectures, but I have to admit I don't find this proof convincing. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the project he starts out with (@3:32) is to prove that every matrix A has this decomposition. But @13:26, he starts out by **assuming** that A has this decomposition, and then he deduces what U, Σ, and Vᵀ must be. But that doesn't show that every matrix A has this decomposition. Instead, it shows that *if A has this decomposition*, then *that's what U, Σ, and Vᵀ must be*. Even if we were to argue that we can obtain such U, Σ, and Vᵀ for any matrix A, prof. Strang doesn't show that by multiplying UΣVᵀ we will get back A for any A.

"28:50 -- The real answer to the question is that the negative there swaps the order of the vector columns. -a2 (b1c3-b3c1) = +a2 (b3c1-b1c3).

This is necessary because the way that the terms in the 3x3 matrix determinant are calculated actually requires you to horizontally scroll the matrix.

|a1 a2 a3|
|b1 b2 b3|  -> a1 (b2c3-b3c2)
|c1 c2 c3|

|a2 a3 a1|
|b2 b3 b1|  -> a2 (b3c1-b1c3)
|c2 c3 c1|

|a3 a1 a2|
|b3 b1 b2|  -> a2 (b1c2-b2c1)
|c3 c1 c2|

The reason why you have to horizontally scroll the matrix has to do with the noncommutativity of transformations. i.e. if you to rotate 90 degrees to the right and then rotate 90 degrees up; you'll be facing a completely different direction than if you rotated 90 degrees up and then 90 degrees to the right.

"I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but the gradual shift into abstract concepts is done flawlessly by Professor Strang. In the first few lectures, really up until the lectures on bases, all of the methods Professor Strang uses to teach the subjects were concrete examples; very little was done with abstract definitions and arbitrary matrices. Over the last few lectures, Prof. Strang has made a gradual shift into abstractness which let's the mode of this sort of thinking sink in. Now, in this lecture, nothing is concrete and no numbers are ever used (until the end) and it feels effortless to understand! This man is a genius when it comes to math education.

"The term universe is very and increasingly overused. Everything has to be clearly defined and understood. Outer “space” is not to be referred to as SPACE. Gravity, as it has been written, is an interaction. It is fundamental. The term inertia is now redefined as “inertia/inertial resistance”. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. Einstein never nearly understood physics/physical experience. Here are the facts.

PRECISELY WHY AND HOW THE BALANCED, TOP DOWN, COMMON SENSE, SIMPLE, EXTENSIVE, AND CLEAR MATHEMATICAL UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS/PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE IS PROVEN BY (AND CONSISTENT WITH) F=MA AND E=MC2:

The following also CLEARLY explains why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution.

c squared represents a dimension of SPACE on balance WITH the fact that the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Indeed, the sky is blue; AND what is THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE (on balance) !! Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light (c) (ON BALANCE); AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND necessarily) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).

General Relativity is directly taken from Special Relativity. E=mc2 is taken directly from F=ma. CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE. I have exposed Einstein. Beautiful.

Note: Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Think carefully about the black “space” AS WELL. Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. THE EYE represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE) that is consistent with F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN/ON BALANCE. Consider what is necessarily, CLEARLY, logically, and by definition the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE ON/IN BALANCE. GREAT !!! Think about what is true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY !!! Great.

Consider what is THE SUN. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GREAT. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This explains the fourth dimension AND the term c4 from Einstein's field equations. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental.

The gravitational “field” is E=mc2 as F=ma. Consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) on balance. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE. I have explained why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE. Carefully consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Consider what is the balanced MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE. E=mc2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE. That's the answer. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).

Get a good LOOK at what are the fully illuminated (AND setting) Moon AND the orange AND setting Sun. Consider what is the blue sky ON BALANCE. Lava is orange, and it is even blood red. THINK !!! SO, ON BALANCE, consider what are the tides !!! Excellent. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Accordingly, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense; as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE. Think about what is the BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE, AND consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE !!! GREAT !!! Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE !!! Wonderful. The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. The tides are CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be ELECTROMAGNETIC/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE, as E=mc2 IS F=ma (ON/IN BALANCE).

"24:27 the author explains that since 1-cos(theta) goes to 0 while theta goes to 0 and considers this a proof. This is not. Because theta goes to 0 also. This limit can't be proven geometrically, because both quantities are going to 0 and even if 1-cos(theta) is presumably much less then theta, it doesn't mean the ratio of them equals to 0, from this geometric construction. Maybe it is equal to 0.0000000000001. So, unfortunately the lim (1-cos(theta))/(theta) = 0 remains mathematically unproven. The prove can be derived from the first remarkable limit (sin(x)/x ---> 1) and fact that cos(x) = 1-2*sin(x/2)*sin(x/2).

"To be clear that I'm not missing something in the lecture, he assumes exp(lambda*t) is a solution to the matrix differential equation BEFORE he has explained what a matrix exponential is or shown how it might be derived, correct?

I'm asking because I want to make sure I'm not missing some section of the video.

I went back and watched parts of it multiple times and I think he is skipping around at some places in a way that makes it hard to follow, even if you're familiar with differential equations and the material up to this point.  I generally like his broad and conceptual approach but in this video I believe there were too many jumps from one line of thought to another.

Seriously,  take the expression for: sin^2(x/2) is equivalent to (1/2)(1-cos(x)), multiply both sides of the identity by 2,  then bring in the x denominator, and divide top and bottom of left side by 2, giving: (sin(x/2))(sin(x/2)/(x/2)).  Limit of a product is product of limits = (0)(1) = 0?

I know the answer is to prove it geometrically,  however he could prove it with identities, and tell the student to look up a book if they required a more rigorous explanation - assuming that's not in an exam!

"If you take this class my advice is first dont let this be your first stat class, you will be in trouble. This professor might be super clear if you already know what he is explaining but if you dont, he is a terrible professor. The only ones that do good are the ones that already took other courses. He knows his stuff of course, but he is not an efficient communicator, he cant clearly think in the student perspective, and his TAs are just like him too. You will be dazed and confused, just a fair warning.. Plus adding to the above he also makes several mistakes in what he writes, and has the annoying habit of speeding up and talking fast as the content gets more complicated, instead of doing the exact opposite like a professor should. Case in point, at 47:04 professor changes variables to x, should be y. Its a small detail right? But this in newly introduced concepts can cause confusion, and put this together with a fast pace, and you will be struggling a lot of things that are quite easy, but because his communication skills are lacking, the easy becomes confusing and difficult fast."

"Beware of his explanation of y= x².  There is a well-defined method of handling this situation where units are treated as mathematical objects.  If x represents some real number times centimeters, like 5cm, then x² = 25cm².  There is no other correct interpretation.  Therefore, y = 25cm², and is an area.  If, like mafl25 writes, he really means the square of the ""magnitude"", then he should realize that a number without a unit _has_ no magnitude—it's just a number.  Is 10 a big number?  Or is it a small number?  What is its magnitude?  If y is really the square of the ""coefficient"" of x, then he must isolate the coefficient by dividing x by cm.  That is, he should write y=(x/cm)² cm, or y=x²/cm.  If you then carry out the rest of the problem, treating units as mathematical constants, you will arrive at the correct solution with the correct units.  This is common practice in solving physics problems.  Always be strict and always get the right answer.  There is no paradox here."

So bad, in fact, that a growing number of universities now virtually insist that the subject be retaken under a competent instructor.  Poor preparation in mathematics tends to feed upon itself, for in mathematics, virtually everything depends upon the thorough mastery of that which came before.  Shall we now pretend that our secondary education in the USA is not the worst in the industrialized world?  Shall we forget that our secondary school educators, with rare exception, are among the most incompetent of those who own college degrees?  And yet, we somehow are willing to trust the instruction of this important topic to these institutions without reservation!

How does he equate the e at @13:20 with the e at @21:34? He assumes that they are the same just because he has used the same letter in both places.

"Prof. Strang is amazing but you should skip this lecture if you are NOT familiar with differential equations. It is too fast paced, and avoids multiple non-distinct eigenvalues. I didn't find the book section very helpful as well. 
The good thing is skipping this ""applications"" lecture doesn't affect the series. I would recommend Edwards-Penney differential equations Chapter 5 if you really want to understand what is going on and where these equations are coming from (i.e. the link between eigenvectors, exponential matrices and different equations). 
You can look at ocw 18.03 section 4 as well, which will explain this at a reasonable pace.
or you can just leave thinking aside and put the following things into memory.
A system of differential equations has a solution in the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of A. Exponential of a matrix is a taylor series with scalar replaced by a matrix and follows the same derivative. For stability, real part of eigenvalues has to be negative." IZqwi0wJovM "23.

"Timestamps and Summary of Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators

0:00 - Review of Banach Spaces 
In the previous lecture, we started with vector spaces (algebraic structures defined over a field, closed by operations of addition & scaling). We examined normed vector spaces, i.e. those with a notion of ""size"". Norms naturally give rise to metrics, furnishing an analytic context. Those normed vector spaces that are complete (every Cauchy sequence converges) with respect to the metric induced by their norm, are called Banach spaces -- central objects of study in functional analysis.

1:13 - Summability: 
Definition: A series is summable if its sequence of partial sums converges. It is absolutely summable if the series of its norms (nonnegative numbers) converges, which is stronger than regular summability. Useful theorem: a space is Banach if and only if the converse holds. 

19:05 - Operators and Linear Functionals. 
Linear operators (or linear maps) between vector spaces are described here as the analog of matrices; there is a correspondence between linear maps of finite-dimensional vector spaces and matrices that represent these transformations on a given basis. Functionals are linear operators from a vector space to its base field.

19:56 - Example of a Linear Operator: 
Consider a continuous map from the unit square to the complex numbers that takes in a function in C([0, 1]) and ""convolves it"" by integrating its product with the aforementioned map over the compact interval [0, 1]. This is linear by the usual properties of integration. 

23:16 - Linear operators in full generality from V -> W. 
A linear operator between two vector spaces satisfies additivity and scalar homogeneity. As algebraic structures, vector spaces are essentially characterized by their closure under addition and scalar multiplication from a base field. The carrying-over of these properties from V to W indicates that linear operators are the ""correct"" structure-preserving maps to study between vector spaces (abstractly, K-linear maps are the morphisms in the category of vector spaces over K). 

26:30 - Continuous Linear Operators
We describe a linear operator as continuous if it preserves convergent sequences. Equivalently, we can formulate continuity in a topological manner: inverse images of open sets under continuous maps remain open. This is important to distinguish in the infinite-dimensional case -- all norms on finite-dimensional vector spaces are equivalent, hence all operators between f.d. spaces are continuous, but this need not hold for Banach spaces (as we've seen, spaces like C([0, 1]) are infinite-dimensional). Unlike general or f.d. vector spaces, Banach spaces express nontrivial analytic information: to study them appropriately, we must restrict to a suitable class of continuous linear maps that do convey this data. 

30:06 - Continuity and Boundedness
Theorem: a linear operator between normed vector spaces is continuous if and only if it is bounded. Informally, knowing that an operator between normed vector spaces ""maps arbitrarily close points to arbitrarily close points"" tells us the same information that it ""maps bounded subsets to bounded subsets"". It turns out that it's enough to show this criterion for continuity at a single point, e.g., the zero vector.  

44:10 -  Example of a Bounded Operator
Interpreting the earlier example as a continuous linear operator from C([0, 1]) -> C([0, 1]), it is clearly continuous when acting on continuous functions. Regarding it as a map between normed vector spaces (in fact, Banach spaces) allows us to view it as a bounded operator, specifically under the supremum norm as discussed in the prior lecture. 

49:30 - The Space B(V, W) 
Given two normed vector spaces V and W, we define B(V, W) to consist of all bounded (eq. continuous) linear functionals V -> W. Define on it the operator norm, which returns the maximal norm of a vector in the image of a given bounded linear operator; by linearity we don't lose any information by normalizing & considering the supremum over the images of just unit vectors. This is checked to satisfy the norm axioms, turning B(V, W) into a normed vector space in its own right. 

58:44 - If W is Banach, so is B(V, W) 
Strengthening the previous observation that B(V, W) is a normed vector space, if we assume that W is Banach (V need only be an NVS) then B(V, W) itself becomes a Banach space. Completeness follows from the initial lemma that a space is Banach when a series is absolutely summable if and only if it is summable. 

1:21:08 - The (Continuous) Dual Space
For any normed vector space V, define its continuous/topological dual space V' to consist of all bounded linear functionals from V to its base field K. (i.e. B(V, K) with the above notation). These are always Banach - for the l^p sequence spaces, examples include (l^1)' = l^∞, but (l^∞)' is not l^1 (not symmetric!). In general (l^p)' = l^q, where 1/p + 1/q = 1 (conjugate exponents); l^2 is special since it is self-dual. Note: for finite-dimensional vector spaces, V' coincides with the usual (algebraic) dual space of all linear functionals V -> K because continuity is immediate. However, it is strictly a subspace of the algebraic dual in infinite dimension, since one can always construct discontinuous linear functionals on infinite-dimensional vector spaces." 78vN4sO7FVU "Lecture 2: Bounded Linear Operators" "MIT 18.102 Introduction to Functional Analysis, Spring 2021" 11017.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

I have a question about the cost of elimination.
Ax=b

For an nxn matrix A
For the 1st pivot, instead of 100^2, shouldn’t it cost 100*99?
2nd pivot, instead of 99^2, shouldn’t it cost 99*98?
3rd pivot, instead of 98^2, shouldn’t it cost 98*87?

So, instead of n^2+(n-1)^2+(n-2)^2+...., shouldn’t it be n(n-1)+(n-1)(n-2)+(n-2)(n-3)+.... instead?


Also, how did he get n^2 for the matrix b?" MsIvs_6vC38 "4. Factorization into A = LU" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 797.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

"About calculating the power of a test (1:13:00 ->), isn't the most conservative choice for theta 3.49? I mean, when the true theta equals 3.49, the power becomes 5 % (with 5 % significance level). This is because the sampling distributions of Xn_bar (standardized) under theta_0 (3.5) and theta_1 (3.49) are basically equal.

Using this logic, the power of a test would always be equal to the significance level. Obviously, there's a flaw in my logic, but where? Prof. Rigollet says that we should look at the worst possible case (1:13:28). In my humble opinion, the worst possible case is when the difference between theta_0 and theta_1 is miniscule.

EDIT:

Ok, so Prof. Rigollet basically answers my question in the next lecture (8. at 13.45 ->). If theta_1 is defined on a set Theta_1, then the power is the value where it is minimized within this set. What I didn't get at first, or got overly confused about, is that in real life I choose my theta_1 basically as my best guess. This way, in general it won't always be equal to the significance level. If I let theta_1 be such that it can be the 'next door neighbor' to my theta_0, then the power will be equal to the significance level." phbw9r1iUDI "7.

He led with x^H*A*x > 0 and for some reason, everything just started to click (x^H*A is an implicit map, so I have ideas about how to analyze things in my other GR class).

"I highly disagree with the resolution of the ""notation problem"" at 19'13"". The problem is well stressed, but ill solved, if a cat ought to be called a cat! 

A little ""mess"" indeed is runing around there, in the lecture notation, and confusion is rising with paradox from a rather different cause than the one stressed out, if RIGOUR is to be called RIGOUR!

The little ""mess"" that is at the core of these confusions is simply that, through the change of variables, though 
f(x,y) = x+y = 2u+v = g(u,v), 
which are NUMERICAL EQUALITIES and which are NUMERICALY true, nevertheless the functions f and g ARE NOT the same since
f : (x,y) --> f(x,y)=x+y, 
and 
g : (u,v) --> g(u,v) = 2u+v, 
WHICH IS equivalently written (since variables are ""DUMMY VARIABLES"") 
g : (x,y) --> g(x,y) = 2x+y.

From this rigourous functional (or algorithmical) way of looking at it,  it's obvious that f and g are DIFFERENT algorithms, that is DIFFERENT functions!

With things clarified this way, all confusions, danger, paradox... simply vanish : 
(df/dx)y = 1, 
and 
(dg/du)v=2 
No more pb!...

More over, be now clearly aware that we can write, with absolute rigour : 
(dg/du)v = (dg/dx)y, 
BUT ONLY IF YOU READ THIS IDENTITY IN THE PROPER WAY ONE SHOULD READ IT, THAT IS THROUGH ""FUNCTIONS SPIRIT"", AND NOT ""number spirit"". Why that? Because variables in these expressions, ARE AND MUST BE LOOKED AT, AS ""DUMMY VARIABLES""! 

More precisely, what both of these expressions (dg/du)v or (dg/dx)y, trully mean, is simply and unambiguously : DIRIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST VARIABLE (OF THE ORDERED PAIR, OF THE CROSS PRODUCT OF SETS), KEEPING THE SECOND ""VARIABLE"" CONSTANT. 
Therefore we could equivalently have written (dg/dk)@  (or any crazy other ""names"" of variables), if we had defined the function ""in such CHART"", labeled (k,@),  by :
g : (k , @) --> 2k+@

THIS is the only way of puting things trully clearly and rigourously, without ever giving rise to any notation confusion or paradox! Simply by calling a function a function, and NOT ""a cat a dog"", messing around with words and concepts, through rather ""physicist"" lasy notations wich turns sometime to prove to be ""bad"" habits. 

It's in fact a CHAIN RULE MISTAKE that is arising when one misleadingly identify f with g. If one realy wants to differentiate with respect to the same variable, x for instance, keeping y constant, it is possible! But to perform that without any mess and mistake, one SHOULD NOT naively compare  (df/dx)y=1 with (dg/du)/v=2, wich are clearly DIFFERENT (and nothing wrong about it!). But instead, one SHOULD think ""functionaly"" instead of ""numericaly""! That means one has to compute clearly the ""CHAINED FUNCTION"" G, which is different from g, but which is related to g by the Change of Variable. 

We thus express, first the change of variable in the PROPER WAY! That is, as the following FUNCTION :
C : (x,y) --> C(x,y) = (u,v) = (x, y - x)
We thus recall that the FUNCTION g is defined as the following algorithm :
g : (@,#) --> 2@ +#,
or equivalently (since what any function trully IS, IS it's defining ALGORITHM!), but more conveniently (for our CHAINING FUNCTIONS GOAL)  :
g : (u,v) --> g(u,v) = 2u+v

These two FUNCTION are now wisely CHAINED to build the FUNCTION G defined as follow :
G(x,y) = g(u,v) = g( (u,v) ) = g(C(x,y)) = (goC)( (x,y) ) = (goC)(x,y)
We now clearly see what is this FUNCTION G : THE CHAINED FUNCTION OF g and C :
G = goC

The central ""o"" meaning the CHAINING (COMPOSITION) OPERATION ON FUNCTIONAL SPACE, defined, in general, for any two function A : E--> F, and B : F --> G, very simply as :
BoA : E --> G , x --> BoA(x) = B(A(x))
Which could thus, aternatively be named ""THE BOA RULE"" instead of the usual ""fog"" and ""gof"" of ""FUNCTION CHAINING""... (joke!)

In our exemple we then get, finaly, since u=x and v=y-x :
G(x,y) = (goC)(x,y)  = g(C(x,y)) = g( (u,v) ) =  g(u,v) = g(x, y-x) = 2x + (y-x) = x +y
SO WE ""DISCOVER"" THAT for all x and all y, we have :
G(x,y) = f(x,y)
That means FUNCTIONAL EQUALITY :
G=f

So what have we done? Turning around? Yes, in a sens, because we have INSISTED in differentiating g with respect to x, IN A NUMERICAL SENS, instead of doing it in a FUNCTIONAL PROPER WAY that is, differentiating with respect to its FIRST variable in the ALGORITHM 
g : (@,#) --> g(@,#) = 2@ + #
Thus, in this NUMERICAL SENS, x is no longer a DUMMY VARIABLE, but a ""NUMBER ATTACHED TO f""! The physicist would call it a ""physical observable"". This way of looking at things makes it complicate and cand lead to confusions if one doesn't clearly understand the CHAIN FUNCTION KEY AND THE IN FACT THE MANIFOLD CHARTS MAPPING (THUS CHANGE OF CHARTS TRANSFORMATIONS, often differentiable for a regular manifold) laying under all this...  

We thus have, in a sens, ""turned around"", leading to G=f! But doing so we nevertheless HAVE CLEARLY WRITEN THINGS IN CHAIN FUNCTION PROPER WAY, that reveal to be EXTREMELY USEFULL in higher and more abstract DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY, where crucial concepts of COVERING and UNIVERSAL COVERING, TANGENT SPACE, GROUP, LIE ALGEBRA, LIE DERIVATIVE, COVARIANT DERIVATIVE, CONNEXIONS, DIFFERENTIAL FORMS,..for instance, are usefully springing, needing CHAINING FUNCTION PROCESS to be clearly understood and mastered!

Finally, often, this abuse of notation which misleadingly sets f=g, will be handled without damage by the ""human computer"", with some habits and agility. BUT only in rather easy area. On the contrary it will lead to catastrophic confusions, misconceptions, darmatically false results and chear non sens interpretations, in more suttle area...alike, not for naming them, general relativity, riemanian differential geomedry, condensed matter, plasma, etc...

CHAINING FUNCTION OPERATION is one of the most simple, but important one in all mathematics! It's the building block of nested structures, one inside the others alike Pandora box, BUT ""BOXES"" THAT REVEAL FASCINATING STRUCTURES ALIKE GROUP, ALGEBRA, CLIFFORD,...TOPOS... :

"This is an absolutely brilliant introduction to the theory of Probability. Many high school textbooks define probability as a frequency of possible outcomes to the total outcomes and get into counting problems. Students would quickly lose interest while solving myriad counting problems involving cards, dies, etc. and never see the bigger picture of probability. Here the professor instead choose to give a broader theoretical context behind the probability in the first lecture. Think what he did. He clearly defined his objective as to give a math framework to uncertainty faced in any field and started to systematically define the terms and rules. To begin with, we could call any uncertain activity that we are interested in, as an experiment and in that experiment, we could define a relevant sample space (he gives examples of irrelevant sample space to stress the importance of defining relevant ss) and then a probability law which quantifies our believes about how the outcomes in the sample space might occur. He stresses on this fact that probability law can be anything and need not be an empirical frequency which we usually observe. Probability of heads in a toss need not be 1/2 or probability of getting any one of the value when a six-sided die is rolled need not be 1/6. We assume them to be 1/2 or 1/6 because we empirically observe it and also logically it makes sense to assign those values when you know that the coin or the dice is not at all biased in any way. But some dices or coins due to their deformities   could favor certain outcomes and need not have equal fairness to all outcomes. This is such a revelation and not many realise this. He deals with uniform probability - finite sample space separately to make this point more clear. Also, the formulation of events that we are interested as subsets of possible outcomes and using pictures to find the probabilities of those events is absolutely beautiful.  He lays down the fundamental axioms and uses them wonderfully to derive the intuitive idea that probability of an event or a subset is nothing but the sum of probabilities of outcomes which are part of that event or subset. When we look at an event this way and also deal with uniform probability law (prob of each outcome is 1/N), we get probability of event as n/N where the formulation comes from  sum of n 1/Ns rather than dumbly solving counting problems for numerator containing possible outcomes of event and denominator containing all outcomes. This way of thinking helps one to understand and use probability theory beyond counting problems. Similarly, equivalence of probability to the areas while dealing with continuous distribution makes lot of sense and problem boils down to finding out the areas that our events occupy." j9WZyLZCBzs "1.

"This class is concerning of the the product of two huge matrices A and B,  assuming in the simple case that  A is [a,b], and B is [cT,dT], and the algorithm is that we choose one column from A and one row from B. For instance, we might choose column a from A and row cT(c transpose) from B, and then we do out product of these two vectors to get a*cT, this will serve as a sampling to simulate (or one of our guesses) the real product AB. As we accumulate more and more of the samples, if we sum all of these out-products together, we will gradually approach the real answer AB. His calculation on the [a, 0], [b,0] business in the fist part is only tryting to capture on average how the algorithm is dealing with one  of the components A in the product AB." z0ykhV15wLw "Lecture 13: Randomized Matrix Multiplication" "MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning, Spring 2018" 10474.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

"So clear the explanation is that for a simple matrix (3X3) I can directly flush out the inverse matrix given the multiplier at each elimination step, without going thru matrix inverse and multiplication. 
Here is the process:
(1) Flip the sign of multiplier at each elimination step. 
(2) Directly add it in the L matrix in the same position (index) of L. 
In the example of 18:00, flip (-2) I get 2, then add 2 in position L[2,1]; flip (-5) I get 5, add 5 in position L[2,3]. So I got L.

BTW, another way to understand that L is better than E is that: 
(1) When producing E, there are interfered operations happening and thus a new (implicit) relationship between row1 and row3 is formed. As a result, a new entry (10) is appearing to reflect the newly created (implicit) relationship among row1 and row3, as shown at the position E[3, 1]. 
(2) When producing L, the operations are in the right order that there are no interfered operations thus no implicit relationships were generated. So we can just plug in the multiplier (the entry) directly to L, without worrying about missing any entries. 
(3) As a side note, the entry value tells about the multiplication, BUT more importantly, the index of each entry tells about he the relationship between rows. Eg. In matrix E32, the entry E[3, 2] = -5, it means the change coming from row2 to row3, with (-5) as the amount. Getting an explicit explanation on the role of entry indexes helps a lot to build some intuitive in a long run.

"I watched this once, taking all notes. Then watched it again (with break) without taking notes. Then I read my notes (after a break). The lecture's quite good! Btw for those that thought the second derivatives thing came out of left field, Du is the directional derivative operator, so you want Du( Du( f(x1,x2,...,xn) ) ), which gives the expressions for x^T*A*x for a connected f and A. This tells us that x^T*A*x is like a second order operation for the derivative of a function when A is the Hessian (matrix of second derivatives) of said function f().

For the 1-dim vector space, they are by serious definition an EQUIVALENT CLASS of infinitely many parrallel affine lines that fill the entire plane. Similarely a 2-dim vestor space is an equivalent class of infinitely many parallel affine planes that fill the entire 3-space R^3. The key word is thus, REPRESENTATION (Vorstellung in German). An affine line is a particular REPRESENTATION, a ""minister"" of a ""King"" which give the DIRECTION : the 1-dim VECTOR SPACE. Similarly an affine plane is a particular REPRESENTATION, a minister of a ""King&Queen"" which fix the TWO-DIRECTION : the 2-dim VECTOR SPACE" 8o5Cmfpeo6g "6.

When is used the non-linear approximation, something should seem unnecessary for a short time.For example, If ve implement the y = 0 on the where equation beginning is dy/y the method won't be operated. professor said you will always face with these problem. if we consider all thing earlier, solution couldnt be reach ant useful information. the solution requires more information like y(0) = 3.

"49:14 friggin, this is why I hate math. Its too convenient how they make it so that they can get an answer. Maybe I am missing something.

multiplying and dividing(m&d) by 0 is illegal but limits cook up stuff by saying that we are not m&ding by 0 but by a very small ""non-zero number""(non-zero being the key and hence the savior in this step). Ok, that makes sense. 

But right in the very next step, he plugs x to be x0 to make the second thing(or term if you want to call it that) zero. Like in one scenario (x-x0) is not a zero, but in another it is? Why is that fair?

Now it makes sense if that final answer is only an approximation. Meaning that the whole limit actually is not zero, but is very closer to zero. But in the case, does it mean that entire calculus' premise is based on approximation?

"Fun fact, not mentioned in the video:

If the matrix A is singular, then the process is losing information because two linearly independent vectors in the input space could be mapped to the same output vector, making them indistinguishable. When the professor discussed the matrix for ordinary differentiation of a polynomial function, notice that it was singular. This corresponds to the arbitrary constant of integration i.e. information will be lost, so you save it ahead of time via initial conditions so you can reconstruct the input vector.

It's true because if you look at the definition of a T - recognizer, it says -:
1. Halts and accepts
2. Halts and rejects
3. Loops and rejects
Now,
Let A be T - recognizable and O be it's recognizer.
Suppose w is a string not in A.
Now, when you look  Ā and it's recognizer Ō( Ō is implemented using O, it does opposite of what O does) and pass w through it, it should accept w, but since you're implementing Ō with the help of O, it loops on w and rejects it.
Therefore it's not always possible for Ā to be recognizable if A is. Infact it's possible on a special condition, which is A must be a decidable language." N28g_YBXY8Y "9. Reducibility" "MIT 18.404J Theory of Computation, Fall 2020" 2601.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

I think MIT's answer was clear enough; their goals are not your goals. They work to educate ALL students - those that can and those that can't afford it.

I fail to see what this has to do with anybody's eaten flesh. And developing international academic standards helps to increase competition which is beneficial to the international body of knowledge. It increases global standards which leads to more motivation to you know, work hard, and stay relevant. It's good for mankind."

"@blackrobe2007 The third row in the matrix says that 0 = b3 - b2 - b1, so the values for b1, b2 and b3 must satisfy the result 0.
And the numbers 1, 5 and 6 for b1, b2 and b3 are good because they turn the equation 0 = b3 - b2 - b1 into 0 = 6 - 5 - 1, which is true.

There is an infinite number of other possible solutions as well --- for example, you could choose b1, b2 and b3 to be 50, 100 and 150, and in that case you would get 0 = 150 - 100 - 50, which is also true." 9Q1q7s1jTzU "8.

(7:16) there are _some_ matrices that do _NOT_ have n-independent eigenvectors, but _most_ of the matrices we deal with do have n-independent eigenvectors.

* Also, the position of Lambda and S should be changed(32:36). You'll see why by just thinking matrix multiplication, and it can also be viewed by knowing A^100=S*Lambda^100*S^-1 and u_0=S*c.
 Thus, it should be S*Lambda^100*c, and this also can be thought of as 'transformation' between the two different bases - one of the two is the set of the egenvectors of A.

They are parallel or coincide when the dot product yields (-1).

"In the concluding ""review"" he reminds us that initial state vector u₀ must be decomposed into eigenvectors. However, he seems refused to say that the eigenvector will look like exponential function [1 λ λ² λ³ ] of eigenvalues λ, http://valjok.blogspot.com/2013/12/eigenvectors-of-recurrence-equations.html. In case you start evolving from y₀ !=1, instead of [y₀ y₁ y₂ y₃  …] = [1 λ λ² λ³], your recursive process evolves through the state variables [y₀ y₀λ y₀λ² y₀λ³ ]. Yet, y₀ is unimportant as long as eigenvector is concerned. Only eigenvalues λ are important. It is cool that [1 λ λ² λ³] is the exponential vector and since exponents must be the solutions of linear differential equations. I just do not understand how why does he explain how our recursion evolves u₀ → u₁ → … (the initial value problem) if our goal is to find all solutions, regardless of what are the boundary conditions." 13r9QY6cmjc "22.

Forward. Trivial.

"I love Prof. Strang and he is awesome. So, I will try to slow this lecture down. 
If you copy the following text into a mathjax friendly interface, you can read all the equations properly.


The basic knowledge we need from calculus is $\frac{d}{dt}$$e^{ax} = ae^{ax}$. Now we have two equations $$\frac{du_1}{dt} = -u_1+2u_2$$ $$\frac{du_1}{dt} = u_1-2u_2$$ I write these equations as $$\begin{matrix} u_1'\\u_2' \end{matrix} = \biggl[\begin{matrix} -1&2\\1&-2 \end{matrix}\biggr] \begin{matrix}u_1\\u_2\end{matrix}$$.

In matrix form, $U' = AU$. Now if I take $e^{\lambda t}k$ where 'k' is a vector as a solution, I get $\lambda e^{\lambda t}k = Ae^{\lambda t}k $, which is $Ak = \lambda k$. Hence lambda gives the power of the exponential in the solution which multiplies an eigenvector k. 

Part two (after minute 29): We already know that a complete set of eigenvectors will form a basis. So we can use eigenvector matrix to write any column vector. Then $u=Sv$; $\frac{du}{dt} = S\frac{dv}{dt} = ASv$, and $u(0) = Sv(0)$

Again from calculus, the solution of $\frac{dx}{dt} = ax$ is $x(t) = ae^{at}x(0)$. Now lets write this equation with a matrix $\Lambda$. For a vector 'v', $\frac{dv}{dt} = \Lambda v$, the solution is $v(t) =  e^{\Lambda t}v(0)$. For 'u', we just substitue the values, we get $$ u(t) = Sv(t) = S e^{\Lambda t} S^{-1}u(0) $$

We started from $U'=AU$. Now we know that if $U = e^{At}$ then it solves the equation. Hence, $e^{At}=S\Lambda e^{\Lambda t} S^{-1}$.

We also know that $e^x = 1+x+x^2/2+x^3/(3!)+....$. Now, let's replace 1 with $I$ and x with $At$ $$e^{At} = I+At+(At)^2/2+(At)^3/(3!)+....$$

Here (minute 40), I will slightly deviate from lecture here: 
$$e^{\Lambda t} = I+\Lambda t+(\Lambda t)^2/2+(\Lambda t)^3/(3!)+....$$

Substituting this in the equation for u(t), 
$$ u(t) = Sv(t) = S (I+\Lambda t+(\Lambda t)^2/2+(\Lambda t)^3/(3!)+....) S^{-1}u(0) $$
$$ u(t) = (I+S \Lambda S^{-1}t+S(\Lambda t)^2S^{-1}/2+S(\Lambda t)^3S^{-1}/(3!)S^{-1}+....) u(0) $$

Since $u(t) = e^{At}u(0)$, and A is $S^{-1}\Lambda S$, we have
$$e^{At} = I+At+(At)^2/2+(At)^3/(3!)+....$$

As before :)

Remember : A is diagonalizeable

I have a thought on this. We know that the reduced row echelon form of A has no more than 1 of ""1"" at each row and cols. If we multiply a row of A (let's say the 1st row) with a col of C^T (let's say 2nd col), we get 0 because each co-factor matrix in 2nd col of C^T (e.g. C21) always consist a zero vector. (C21 consists of zero vector of col  1 of A). Thus, their product is 0.

Also when the Professor says f' > 0, we does not specify where, does he mean f' > 0 for all points between [a,b] because the function can be increasing from a to b (ie f(b) > f(a)) and MVT says is there is some point c between [a,b] for which f'(c) > 0 and there can be other points c' where f(c') < 0. so the reverse is not true, ie if f'(c) > 0, for some c between [a,b] that does not specific f is increasing." 4Q37iOyBq44 "Lec 14 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007" "MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006" 14732.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

He knows his stuff, of course, but you know how some people are just terrible at teaching? That is it.. And he has no idea either that in fact he lost most of the class half way through.. Young still so maybe he can become better but this class was something else I tell you.. It also didnt help that this course should have been divided into 2 or even 3 parts.

"It may be worth to note that instead of partial derivatives one can work with derivatives as the linear transformations they really are, and also looking at the networks in a more structured manner thus making clear how the basic ideas of BPP apply to much more general cases. Several steps are involved. 

1.- More general processing units. 
Any continuously differentiable function of inputs and weights will do; these inputs and weights can belong, beyond Euclidean spaces, to any Hilbert space. Derivatives are linear transformations and the derivative of a neural processing unit is the direct sum of its partial derivatives with respect to the inputs and with respect to the weights; this is a linear transformation expressed as the sum of its restrictions to a pair of complementary subspaces. 

2.- More general layers (any number of units). 
Single unit layers can create a bottleneck that renders the whole network useless. Putting together several units in a unique layer is equivalent to taking their product (as functions, in the sense of set theory). The layers are functions of the of inputs and of the weights of the totality of the units. The derivative of a layer is then the product of the derivatives of the units; this is a product of linear transformations. 

3.- Networks with any number of layers. 
A network is the composition (as functions, and in the set theoretical sense) of its layers. By the chain rule the derivative of the network is the composition of the derivatives of the layers; this is a composition of linear transformations. 

4.- Quadratic error of a function. 
...
——-
Since this comment is becoming too long I will stop here. The point is that a very general viewpoint clarifies many aspects of BPP. 

If you are interested in the full story and have some familiarity with Hilbert spaces please google for papers dealing with backpropagation in Hilbert spaces. A related article with matrix formulas for backpropagation on semilinear networks is also available. 

For a glimpse into a completely new deep learning algorithm which is orders of magnitude more efficient, controllable and faster than BPP search in this platform for a video about deep learning without backpropagation; in its description there are links to a demo software. 

The new algorithm is based on the following very general and powerful result (google it): Polyhedrons and perceptrons are functionally equivalent. 

For the elementary conceptual basis of NNs see the article Neural Network Formalism.

"If you are reading this Post Rapture:
Rev 14:6 - And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
Rev 14:7 - Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

Pre Rapture:
Mark 16:15 - And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
 - You've broken 1 of the 10 commandments and are guilty of sin if you've ever lied, or stolen, or lusted.  Works of righteousness will not save you.  Jesus Christ is the only way.
Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans 10:9 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

I ask you to rethink what you know about God.  Rethink what you've been taught.  God wants a relationship, not a religion.  
 - Jesus came to die for all mankind ... not kill them.
 - Jesus came to bring salvation for all mankind ... not condemnation.
 - Jesus came to be an example, a light to the world .. not to force people into submission.

1.  Humble yourself before the Lord
2.  Admit to the breaking of His laws as found in the 10 commandments
3.  Ask for His forgiveness for those sins
4.  By faith, believe Jesus died on the cross for your sins
5.  Confess with your mouth that Jesus is your Lord and Savior

39:00 With an example of orthogonal rotation matrix:
1. Trace has to be the sum of the eigenvalues and the det has to be the product of the eigenvalues.
2. There is a trouble in orthogonal rotation matrix since we don’t have any eigenvector parallel to the Ax. The eigenvalues will appear to be the imaginary number.

So in same sense empty product should be 1 as you multiply with your first term a with 1 you get a. And 0! is an empty product, so it value should be 1.

"For that first example, I don’t think assuming the solution was the Iinear combination of exponentials was the right way to go. Of course, it’s correct, but it’s not very instructive. I solved this example problem in my own, and this is what I did:
Broke the system of odes into a system of difference equations (finite element approximations of the odes). Then I solved for the vector one node away in terms of the first node by reapplying something like u_(n+1)=A*u_n over and over. The computational hack here is that A being middle diagonalizable matrix doesn’t actually need to be multiplied many, many times. Once you get your answer, take the limit of your solution such that the difference equations converge to the original odes, and boom, you have your solution.

"*Question:* what is the relationship between rank(A) and rank(A^T)? Does rank(A) = rank(A^T) in general?

The professor seems to be hinting at this, but rref(A) only preserves the column space, so it doesn’t seem so trivial to me. Any insight is highly appreciated.

Edit: I found the answer. rank(A) = rank(A^T) by virtue of the fact that linear independence of the columns implies linear independence of the rows, even for non-square matrices. I proved this for myself this evening. The main idea for the proof (at least how I did it) is that if you have two linearly dependent rows, one above the other say, row reduction kills the lower one (reduces number of possibly independent rows). Killing off the row (making the row all zeros) also makes it so that the given row can’t have a pivot. Thus, we’ve reduced the number of potential pivot columns by one. That’s the relationship in a nutshell. The math is only slightly more involved" nHlE7EgJFds "10. The Four Fundamental Subspaces" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 237.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

"Changing the order of integration in double integral is indeed equivalent to using the integration By Parts. Let's see how for this example:
Put $f(x)=\int_x^{\sqrt{x}}\frac{e^y}{y}dy.$ Then $f'(x)=\frac{e^{\sqrt{x}}}{2x}-\frac{e^x}{x}.$ and so
$xf'(x)=\frac{e^{\sqrt{x}}}{2}-e^x.$
The required integral is $I=\int_0^1 f(x)dx.$ Apply By Parts
by considering $u=f(x)$ and $dv=dx$ to get
 $I=(1f(1)-0f(0))-\int_0^1(\frac{e^{\sqrt{x}}}{2}-e^x)dx.$
To find the first integral, use the u-substitution $u=\sqrt{x}$
and the integration By Parts again!" YP_B0AapU0c "Lec 16: Double integrals | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007" "MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007" 3141.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

"n^2 + (n-1)^2 + (n-2)^2 + ... + 2^2 + 1^2 = n * (n+1) * (2n + 1) / 6. As n becomes ""big"", this sum approaches n^3 / 3. His approach in the lecture is also good. Plot a graph of y = x^2 and identify the points x = n, x = n-1, x = n-2, ..., x = 1, and you'll find that if n is big enough, the discrete plots start to look more and more like the curve y = x^2, which then allows you to approximate the area under the curve. Again, what you get for a reasonably large n is n^3 / 3. One final thing is, if these operations are performed in a loop, you'll need way more time, because his analysis assumes an operation on an entire row. To achieve this, you would need vectorized code that can operate on the entire row at once. Hope this helped someone :)" MsIvs_6vC38 "4.

"This give a easiest geometric interpretation of why singular matrices has no inverse. This kind of matrices take n-dimensional vectors as input and the output is in a vector of smaller dimension, and different vectors can have the same output, so you can´t have an inverse transformation because you don't know to wich of all of this original vectors corresponds the vector in the space of smaller dimension. More importat, that's why you need an initial condition in integrals to know the original function, because the derivative is making this same process and only with the inverse ('integral ) you can't tell which is the original function."

"I find this course especially a great one. Probably many people will argue that it seems easy, the professor speaks slowly, many concepts are probably studied in high school, and is worried about the critical points in his explanation. And that's the point.. In one of this lectures the students asks more questions than in the complete calculus course I took in mi Spanish university 25 years ago. 
In my course the professor took for granted much concepts that we didn't had, taught for himself (he was a mathematician of course, but we were studying chemistry..), worried more of finishing the lesson in time (at full speed) without taking into account the main key points of confusion a first year college has. I know there's a more theoretical (for mathematicians) courses of calculus in MIT, more formal and pure mathematics, but this is the best calculus course a first year college should have."

"I always found it interesting how the US system of teaching calculus has evolved into two subjects - calculus and real analysis. I guess the motivation for calculus is to introduce some of the concepts and build the practical skill of calculating derivatives, integrals and apply them to analysis of functions and generally solving practical problems. The rigorous introduction of the subject is left to real analysis which I guess not all students learn. For me, analysis became clear once I looked into how the subject developed over time, how Newton/Leibniz saw the connection between the derivative and the integral. I always wondered why all those people were so busy with calculating areas and why the tangent was something they were interested in. Also, the limit process always looked as a cheat until the moment someone suggested it was a best approximation, the way to do away with infinity and replace it with the nearest best approximation. Just wondering if calculus presented in such a form rises more questions than it answers.. I guess the joy of applying the method to different problems overshadows the gaps here and there.." kCPVBl953eY "Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007" "MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006" 5041.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

"I think (but am not necessarily sure) that positive definite matrices can have non orthogonal eigen vectors. Symmetric matrices can definitely have non orthogonal eigen vectors.

Posted this as a reply to a comment but reposting it here:

Symmetric matrices don't necessarily require the eigenvectors to be orthogonal, I think the same is also applicable to positive definite matrices.

Consider the identity matrix for example. It can be decomposed into a product of a non orthogonal matrix of two arbitrary (but independent) eigen vectors the the lambda matrix (identity) and the inverse of the first matrix.

It would be great if someone could confirm the same about positive definite matrices." HgC1l_6ySkc "32. Quiz 3 Review" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 5992.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

"Globaly very Great lecture (19/20), congratulations.
But I notice at 34:30 nevertheless a great confusion, between VECTOR SPACE and AFFINE SPACE. Actualy, the 0 vector MUST indeed be in all vector spaces BUT has NO FIXED ""PLACE"" in the plane. The word ""place"" is in fact irrelevant for a vector in general and the 0 vector in particular. It is a beast that doesn't live in the affine plane, and so has no ""location"" in it. That's a crucial point. A dual way of painting this need understanding that the affine origine has indeed fixe coordinates, namely (0,0), ok, BUT it's location in the plane is ARBITRARY (by homogeneity argument somehow) so as the ""orientation"" of the axes (by isotropic argument somehow).
For similar reasons the straight line OF the origine is NOT LESS a vector space than the one THROUGH the origine. And even much more than that. In fact these two affine lines are EQUIVALENT AFFINE REPRESENTATIONS of the SAME 1-dim vector space which is, by definition, essentialy a DIRECTION (their comon one), and THAT IS what matters. It may seem to beginers that this confusing situation is a paradox. In fact, NOT AT ALL. Nevertheless, to overcome it, it is crucial to understand that a 1 dim vector space is NOT in fact an (affine) straight line (not more the one THROUGH the affine origine than the one OF the affine origine) BUT essentialy a DIRECTION, that is to put it in a rather intuitive and visual formulation, an EQUIVALENT CLASS of infinitely many parallel (all pointing in the same direction) affine straight lines filling the entire plane (in 2 D).
""Complementary"" the ZERO VECTOR is ""LOCATED"" NO WHERE in particular in the affine plane. In fact it doesn't live in it BUT in the infinite family of infinite equivalent classes. To visualize it one could think of it through a pedagogical metaphore of a strange being : an ISOTROPIC ""1 dim"" vector space, that is, a strange ""line"" pointing in all direction equivalently, which is an impossible mission except for a degenerate line reduced to a point. Any affine point can be seen as a equivalent representation of the 0 vector pointing in NO DIRECTION." JibVXBElKL0 "5.

"Hi, Thank you for these nice videos.

One small note : at 27:40, I think that to justify the use of uniform distribution for θ, one should use entropy, so given that uniform distribution (discrete r.v)/Guassian (continious r.v with a given 1st and 2nd moments) has the highest entropy, i.e the highest degree of randomness, if we estimate/detect θ assuming those distributions, the solution would be the best (in randomness sense, so lower probability of error maybe ?) also for other distributions based θ, given that those other distributions have lower degree of randomness.

"Having a competent instructor teach undergraduate mathematics is a key differentiator in college.   Most often undergraduate courses will be taught by either the the incompetent, the unskilled, or by poor communicators.  Often all three in combination.    Requiring your best instructors to indoctrinate the freshmen is seen as a waste by many as the drop out rate is high and the lectures are trivial.   Sadly this logic reinforces high drop out and trivial lectures.    My calculus 1 course had a 50% drop out rate and then a 50% failure rate.   The lecturers generally could not speak English, could not teach calculus, and to give them the benefit of a doubt were completely indifferent to the students (as opposed to entirely incompetent).   It  was essentially a farce.   The best strategy was to read the text, do the problems and attend the labs.   The classes were not worth attending.

The Socratic method was generally not seen till late in the 4rth year when it was far to late to salvage most students from rote memorization and pandering to professors idiosyncrasies.   MOOC's have opened up an opportunity for learning that exceeds the abilities of most universities to provide.    Industry has yet to recognize this,  Universities have yet to recognize this, but there are avid students around the world that will begin to generate new science, mathematics, literature without the benefit of an Ivy league education or even a piece of paper recognizing their accomplishments.

"HELP! I think Strang might have got WRONG around 05:40. I think P U L is a SUBSPACE of P as P & L itself is a subspace of P.

Think like this: let p & l be a vector from P & L respectively. than u=p+l belongs to
P U L and u lies within P as p is within P and l is also within P.

Also c*p & c*l belongs to P & L respectively where c is scalar as P&L are subspace. so c*u=(c*p + c*l) belongs to P U L. 

Finally, zero vector lies in both P & L. so Zero vectors belongs to P U L.

"O Conselho de Administração do PRISA (grupo que publica o EL PAÍS) aprovou os termos para o refinanciamento da dívida, que alarga o prazo até 2025 e reforça a liquidez da empresa. Ao mesmo tempo, acordou a venda do negócio de educação da Santillana de Espanha à finlandesa Sanoma por um valor do ativo de 465 milhões de euros, informou à Comissão Nacional do Mercado de Valores, órgão regulador do mercado de ações espanhol.

“Estas operações permitirão acelerar a transformação digital do Grupo, centrada nos sistemas de aprendizagem Ed-Tech, na América Latina, e nos modelos de subscrição dos seus negócios dos Média”, salienta em comunicado.

O acordo de refinanciamento da dívida prevê alargar o prazo até março de 2025, com um custo inicial de 5,5% e um custo total médio de 7% durante a vigência do contrato. Contempla a amortização de 400 milhões de dívida (ficando a dívida líquida total cortada em mais de 30%) e estabelece um marco para uma futura separação efetiva dos negócios da Educação e dos Meios de Comunicação. Com este refinanciamento, a empresa contará com cerca de 275 milhões para reforçar sua liquidez e facilitar o desenvolvimento dos planos estratégicos de negócios.

O preço pela venda da Santillana Espanha foi estabelecido sobre um valor de empresa de 465 milhões de euros, o que representa 9,6 vezes o EBITDA médio do ciclo educativo do período 2017/2019, para além dos múltiplos das principais transações comparáveis no setor. O preço será liquidado integralmente em dinheiro, na data de encerramento da operação, uma vez descontada a dívida líquida, a 30 de junho de 2020, do negócio objeto da transação, estimada em 51 milhões de euros. A venda gerarà um ganho de capital estimado em 385 milhões de euros.

O diretor-executivo do PRISA, Manuel Mirat, considera que “com estas operações, o Grupo demonstra a validade do percurso delineado, que mereceu também a confiança dos credores”. “Com a venda da Santillana Espanha, verifica-se a capacidade da PRISA de criar valor. Além disso, ao eleger a Sanoma, conseguimos que a Santillana contribua de forma notória para a conformação de um dos grandes líderes europeus no setor da Educação”, assinala Mirat em comunicado.

O encerramento da operação está pendente da obtenção da respetiva autorização das autoridades competentes espanholas, da autorização da Assembleia Geral de Acionistas da PRISA e da formalização do refinanciamento.

Após a venda do negócio da Santillana Espanha, que representa 21% do negócio do Grupo Santillana, o Grupo concentrará os seus esforços no impulso dos sistemas de aprendizagem na América Latina. A Santillana é a única operadora global de educação presente em todos os países da América Latina, onde tem uma posição e proposta de valor únicas, projetando para outros mercados os modelos de subscrição desenvolvidos no Brasil e alcançando através deles um total de 1,7 milhões de alunos na região, com um crescimento de 25% no último período anual."

"I love how confident and spontaneous Professor Strang is. He is not afraid to make mistakes in front of his students and term them as “to finish” examples for later examination as he moves forward and tries another example in hope of “doing it right” the second try. His hesitation which is a result of high brain activity may confuses you sometimes and throws you off tangent, but it emphasizes the need for continuous examination and pondering while you are presenting the material. He could to the naive critic have prepared better for his lectures to have a smoother sail, but he seems on purpose to present himself like a student who is just doing it for the first time, which is really quite sly and entertaining if you don’t find it confusing. You may for that reason have to wind back his lectures and watch it a second or even third time to get a full appreciation of his style.

"Thank you, sir!!! 

It has started with a simple matrix and look it is creating the whole universe, explaining the existence. That's the beauty of it!!!
It feels amazing when I spend my time with the abstract world.
My intuition says ""There is something still hiding and right now you are in the dark place so either you can't get out from that place or you can't stand still"". 

Let's look at these beautiful connections:

A matrix has some columns and these are called vectors. The vectors are independent if their combinations give no zero except if they are zero vectors {How???) and dependent if the opposite of the statement is true. 
What is the connection between independence and null space and the rank of a matrix?
the vector are Independent when the Null space of that matrix = zero vector and
the rank is no of columns (Think !!!) =Invertible = nonsingular matrix.
For dependence of vectors there exists at least one free variable ( Do you know what is free variable?) and rank is less than the number of columns. ( Singular???)

The linear combination of the whole vectors forms space. (Here your existence, experience, can be explained!!! Can you visualize it in your imagination? )

The basis for a vector space is the sequence of all the vectors with two properties
1) They are independent ( look independence again comes here!!!)
2)They span a space ( what is span??? Think!!!) ( What space can be formed from these vectors (1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,1,1)? )

The basis!!!  The children of a space!
In a three dimensional space with any two vectors, what is the basis for that space?
(Is it  a plane or a space or a line???)

Every basis for a vector space has the same number of vectors given space and that's called
the dimension of the space. The number of vectors is very important.(why??? Think!!!)

The Dimension of a column and a null space???

The dimension of the column space=The rank of matrix =Number of pivot columns. Remember, it does not depend directly on the dimension of the matrix. 

The dimension of the null space = number of columns - rank of the matrix = The number of free variables.
The basis of the column space is generated from the all the linearly independent vectors of a matrix given a space. If We know the dimension of the space then a couple of vectors that are independent be a basis.

Algorithm
1)Matrix -> row reduced echelon form->no of pivot columns->rank->dimension of column space
2) free columns = no of columns - rank= dimension of the null space." yjBerM5jWsc "9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 9530.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

The row picture is probably what your school math teacher taught you. This just confused me a lot. I don't like dot products, but the ""combinations of columns"" is very intuitive once you can visualize why it works.

"So I was a bit confused by his (a,b) notation but I think I got it. 
So in his 'practice' example we have mean = 1/2 (a,b). (a,b) is really the matrix [a b]. With probabilities 1/2 we pick either the matrix [a 0] or [0 b]. So we average the matrices to get 1/2 [a,b]. Now two samples means we get two matrices randomly with the above probabilities and add them. If X is a random variable, mean(2X) = 2 mean(X), so we multiply the mean by two to get [a b], the original matrix.

"In the case where x approaches 0 in the expression of (cosx-1)/x, one can find the value of the expression using geometric intuition.

When ""angle x"" approaches 0 then the arc length ""x"" becomes equal to sinx, just as Professor explained in the video. But (cosx-1)/x is another nut to crack.

Let there be a *single* triangle made by the radius of the unit circle and the x-axis with hypotenuse ""H"", adjacent side ""A"" and opposite side ""P"". Let the angle made by the radius to the x-axis be ""x"". Now let's take a look at (cosx-1)/x

We know from Professor's explanation that Arc length *""x""= sinx* (when x approaches 0), so put the value of x=sinx in (cosx-1)/x, and we can write (cosx-1)/x as:

*(cosx-1)/sinx*
Rearrange it as:

*(Cosx/sinx) - (1/sinx)*
Note that (Cosx/sinx)=A/P and (1/sinx)=H/P {basic definitions}

(cosx-1)/x=
(A/P)-(H/P)=(A-H)/P

Now take a look at Hypotenuse and the Adjacent side.
As angle x gets smaller and smaller, Hypotenuse moves towards the adjacent and when x becomes infinitesimally small, *Hypotenuse ""H"" will nearly become equal to Adjacent ""A""* ( or you can say that ""H"" will nearly superimpose on ""A"")

Therefore *H=A* for a very small angle x.
So :
(cosx-1)/x       =(A-A)/P=0

P.S》I thought about sharing this because there were a lot comments regarding this problem. I'm not trying to act like a nerd or genius, as I have been learning calculus for only some time and and it is pretty obvious that my skill is infinitesimally weak with respect to that of the Professors of MIT.

The instantaneous speed of the height increase is the same as that of a cylinder with base area equal to the surface area of water at that height, so it’s just volume/time divided by area or 2/4pi = 1/2pi.

"Timestamps and Summary of Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory 

0:00 - Motivation and Introduction 
Functional analysis works with vector spaces that are sometimes infinite-dimensional, using the techniques of analysis to study their structure & functions defined on them. Besides existing as a pure mathematical discipline, it finds applications in partial differential equations and physics. 

5:27 - Review of Vector Spaces
Vector spaces are defined over a field (here, R or C) and are closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Every vector space has a basis, or a maximal spanning set; its dimension is the cardinality of any basis (this is well-defined). e.g. Finite-dimensional vector spaces over R: R^n (n-fold Cartesian product)

13:46 - An Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space
The set of continuous functions from [0, 1] to the complex numbers forms a vector space (sum, multiple of any elements are still in the VS). But the countably infinite set {1, x, x^2,...} is linearly independent in C([0, 1]). 

16:26 - Norms 
To perform analysis, we require a concrete notion of ""proximity"" or ""size"" on our spaces. A norm assigns to each vector in a vector space some nonnegative real number; as a map it is positive semidefinite, homogeneous, and satisfies the triangle inequality. 
A seminorm is similar to (but weaker than) a norm; it satisfies the latter two conditions but is not necessarily definite. A vector space endowed with a norm is a normed vector space: these are central objects of study in functional analysis.

21:15 - Metric Spaces
A metric on a set provides a notion of distance between its points. It is an identity-indiscernible, symmetric, and triangle inequality-satisfying function; a space with such a distance function is called a metric space (has the metric topology) 

23:08 - Norms Induce Metrics
Given a norm on a vector space, it induces a metric in the natural way. This allows us to talk about ideas like convergence, completeness, etc. with regards to normed vector spaces. 

26:11 - Examples of Norms (and NVS) 
Euclidean norm on R^n, C^n provide us with the most familiar notion of distance. We can consider more broadly the family of norms called p-norms, of which the Euclidean norm is a special case (taking p = 2). When p = ∞ we consider the norm that picks out the maximal component of a vector in n-space. 

32:45 - The Space C_∞{X}
From a metric space X we consider the space C_∞{X} of all continuous, bounded functions from X to the complex numbers. This indeed forms a vector space - on it, we can introduce the supremum norm that measures the maximal value a function takes. This turns C_∞(X) into a normed vector space. If we take X to be some compact interval like [0, 1], the boundedness of continuous functions are automatic.

39:24 - The Supremum Norm and Uniform Convergence
When asking what convergence in this metric means for functions in C_∞(X), we find it translates to uniform convergence in the familiar sense from real analysis. 

42:20 - l^p-Spaces
The l^p spaces consist of p-summable sequences. When p = 2, these are square-summable, etc. and these are all defined to be the sequences on which the respective p-norms resolve finitely. 

46:38 - Banach Spaces
We are interested in special cases of normed vector spaces that mimic the situation/structure in Euclidean spaces, namely, their completeness. We have seen that norms (on vector spaces) give rise to metrics, with respect to which we make sense of convergence of sequences. Cauchy sequences are those whose terms tend arbitrarily close; every convergent sequence is Cauchy, but the converse doesn't necessarily hold (the rationals have many ""holes"": one can construct a sequence of rationals that close in on sqrt(2) but can't converge to it in Q). Spaces for which the converse does hold, i.e. Cauchy sequences converge, are complete with respect to that given metric. Banach spaces are normed vector spaces that are complete with respect to the metric induced by the norm. 

49:52 - Examples of Banach Spaces
R^n, C^n are Banach spaces with respect to any of the aforementioned p-norms. These provide relatively trivial examples, but foundational ones. 

50:39 - C_∞(X) is Banach 
A useful nontrivial example - the normed vector space of continuous, bounded functions X -> C actually forms a Banach space with respect to the supremum metric. The process of showing that it is a Banach space amounts to exhibiting completeness, and is instructive in demonstrating the general procedure for showing that a space is Banach: first take a Cauchy sequence & come up with a candidate for its limit, then show that this proposed limit lies in the space, and finally show that the convergence does occur." uoL4lQxfgwg "Lecture 1: Basic Banach Space Theory" "MIT 18.102 Introduction to Functional Analysis, Spring 2021" 11016.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

For example (1 0 0) is on the X axis and (0 1 0) is on the Y axis. But the sum of the (1 1 0) is not on either of those lines.

"It may be worth to note that instead of partial derivatives one can work with derivatives as the linear transformations they really are. 

Also, looking at the networks in a more structured manner makes clear that the basic ideas of BPP apply to very general types of neural networks. Several steps are involved. 

1.- More general processing units. 
Any continuously differentiable function of inputs and weights will do; these inputs and weights can belong, beyond Euclidean spaces, to any Hilbert space. Derivatives are linear transformations and the derivative of a neural processing unit is the direct sum of its partial derivatives with respect to the inputs and with respect to the weights. This is a linear transformation expressed as the sum of its restrictions to a pair of complementary linear subspaces. 

2.- More general layers (any number of units). 
Single unit layers can create a bottleneck that renders the whole network useless. Putting together several units in a unique layer is equivalent to taking their product (as functions, in the sense of set theory). The layers are functions of the of inputs and of the weights of the totality of the units. The derivative of a layer is then the product of the derivatives of the units; this is a product of linear transformations. 

3.- Networks with any number of layers. 
A network is the composition (as functions, and in the set theoretical sense) of its layers. By the chain rule the derivative of the network is the composition of the derivatives of the layers; this is a composition of linear transformations. 

4.- Quadratic error of a function.

With the additional text down below this is going to be excessively long. Hence I will stop the itemized previous comments. 

The point is that a sufficiently general, precise and manageable foundation for NNs clarifies many aspects of BPP. 

If you are interested in the full story and have some familiarity with Hilbert spaces please google for our paper dealing with Backpropagation in Hilbert spaces. A related article with matrix formulas for backpropagation on semilinear networks is also available. 

We have developed a completely new deep learning algorithm called Neural Network Builder (NNB) which is orders of magnitude more efficient, controllable, precise and faster than BPP. 

The NNB algorithm assumes the following guiding principle:
The neural networks that recognize given data, that is, the “solution networks”, should depend only on the training data vectors. 

Optionally the solution network may also depend on parameters that specify the distances of the training vectors to the decision boundaries, as chosen by the user and up to the theoretically possible maximum. The parameters specify the width of chosen strips that enclose decision boundaries, from which strips the data vectors  must stay away. 

When using the traditional BPP the solution network depends, besides the training vectors, in guessing a more or less arbitrary initial network architecture and initial weights. Such is not the case with the NNB algorithm. 

With the NNB algorithm the network architecture and the initial (same as the final) weights of the solution network depend only on the data vectors and on the decision parameters. No modification of weights, whether incremental or otherwise, need to be done. 

For a glimpse into the NNB algorithm, search in this platform our video about : 
NNB Deep Learning Without Backpropagation. 

In the description of the video links to a free demo software will be found. 

The new algorithm is based on the following very general and powerful result (google it): Polyhedrons and Perceptrons Are Functionally Equivalent. 

For the conceptual basis of general NNs in see our article Neural Network Formalism.

"My work doesn't require linear algebra, so I'm studying this to understand what my colleagues are up to and how some of the instrumentation I work with operates.  After looking at the textbook I thought this would be over my head, but the lectures are excellent. Plus, there is no stress in this course or in the presentation.  When I don't understand something I would look it up on line elsewhere, but that wasn't often necessary.  In other lectures we get the mechanics, but not enough to go through understand the concept behind the mechanics.  

I stop either before or after a new concept is presented and try to play with the example matrix on a piece of paper trying to figure out the next bit of the lecture before Prof. Strang explained it.  More than half the time I was wrong, but I got it enough times to gain confidence. In order to make the matrix manipulations easier I did all the calculations for each entry  in row by column dot products.  This made for a messy piece of paper, but avoided arithmetic errors and communicative multiplication errors.  After doing this, my error rate went way down.

Thank you. MIT!  Thank you Professor Strang!

"Randomness is relative, it does not have a absolute meaning. It is wrong to say that something is random or that something is not random. You could say that something is more random or less random depending on the criteria that is being used. You could even eventually consider a scale do measure ""randomness"" depending on the outcome distribution type of a variable.  The true meaning of ""randomness"" would be, for instance, a discrete variable whose possible outcomes have EXACTLY the same probability of happening. The more random a discrete variable is the more likely it's outcome distribution follows a certain type (independently of the specific values that it will assume). A uncertain outcome of a discrete variable may reveal or prove itself as being more or less random considering the type of outcome distribution that it will take. All the exercises that are done resolving binominal, polinominal, multinominal, call them what you want distributions are assuming that all possible values of a discrete variable have exactly the same probability/chance of happening. In other words they' re assuming that the variable is actually random to it's fullest extent. The truth is that the correct answer to these problems is only theoretic because in application it would be impossible in most cases to replicate randomness. This would mean that the actual practical, real life answer to all these exercises would have to consider a more likely convergent distribution type in comparison to the more likely theoretic random distribution type. A random variable is indeed a variable but should not be initially considered random until  proven, through a certain number of trials (the more the better),  to have a more likely theoretical random outcome distribution type . A random variable could be associated with a function (with no input values and with a given range of possible outcome values that follow a certain distribution type).  The possible values that a discrete variable could take doesn't necessarily have to be numbers. They could be anything including shapes, colors, objects, symbols. In other words they could represent anything. This would be the big difference compared to continuous variables.Take the example of dices that, as everybody knows, assume the following outcomes ""1,2,3,4,5,6"". You could consider the numbers as being symbols and not numbers. In this particular case the outcome values ""1,2,3,4,5,6"" could be looked at as being symbols without any arithmetic value. In this case any correlation between the sequence of these symbols and their distribution should be seen as a coincidence. Meaning that there is no sense to calculate the mean or the variance in this particular case, because there is no arithmetic correlation value between symbols or things independently of a more or less random outcome." 3MOahpLxj6A "5.

"If A^T A V = V S is the spectral decomposition of A^T A with S diagonal and V orthogonal, we have that (A V)^T (A V)= S. Hence, the nonzero columns of AV, which is associated with the nonzero columns of A, is orthogonal with all other nonzero columns of AV. Hence, is possible to find an orthogonal matrix U such that A V = U sqrt(S) -- note that the diagonal of S give us the squared norm of each column of AV, which means this is completely fine. Now, this means A=U sqrt(S) V^T. Completing U, if necessary, we have the SVD decomposition. In practice, after the calculation of the spectral decomposition of A^T A, we would calculate the Kern of (AV)^T -- orthogonal to Im(AV) -- and find an orthogonal basis to it, and of course, all the singular values associated with this process would be zero." rYz83XPxiZo "6.

Instead, as he never gave any algeabric description of the vector field, he implicitly assumes (and I think by mistake) that the vector field is tangent to the trajectory along the entire trajectory (i.e. F dot dr = |F||dr|).

"This type of differentiation seriously blew my mind! :-))) Something that I think can be seriously seriously useful. A bit difficult though to understand it right from this presentation.... 

Where this technique should really score is when you need to do derivatives on numerical functions that you cannot really differentiate by calculus to get high accuracy derivatives. Meaning for example calculating derivatives for parameters when using ode solvers and other alike stuff.

For those you would have to either do finite difference approximations which are quite bad (and meaning also simulating the ode twice at least, thus effectively doing same amount of calculations) , or well how on earth would you calculate an analytical derivative for the whole chain of operations? This would be rightout crazy it seems yet maybe not impossible ... ? 

Is there any comparison for how well the differentiation method performs with the log function which is calculated as a continued fraction? I mean how accurate is the dual component of log(x_dual) compared to 1/x?  And in case 1/x is better would it then make sense to implement a custom derivative part returning 1/x to the dual component?" rZS2LGiurKY "Lecture 36: Alan Edelman and Julia Language" "MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning, Spring 2018" 10947.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

It feels like if I know I picked a blue marble, then there should be more than a 1/6 chance of that marble coming from cup A.  I guess because since cup A i this case is 100 percent blue?

The cost of b is not EXACTLY n^2 operations like he says in the video. 
Yes there are n elements, and we assume that all the elements are non-zero from the beginning. But that doesn't mean that EVERY element are being changed. For this to be true(that we are using n^2 operations) we ALSO must assume that there is no 1's in the pivot positions from the beginning. For example if it were 1's in all the pivot positions from the beginning the cost of b would be n^2 - 100(unlikely, but as an example) So the cost of b is not exactly but CLOSE to n^2."

That's why they make sure you DO know what a derivative/limit etc. is.

"About 2 years ago, I failed a college linear algebra exam, and not only that, but I got the lowest in the class by a whopping 2 standard deviations (if I remember correctly). Eventually I dropped the course--I was so bored and discouraged by the professor's way of writing the textbook on the board every lecture that I looked for other sources to prepare for when I would have to take it again. I came across Prof. Strang preaching the 4 fundamental subspaces one day at my custodial job at 5 am. To say that it completely changed everything is a bit of an understatement. Every day, I would rush to work (again, keep in mind this is at 5am!), beast through all my work in about 2 hours, and then watch Prof. Strang teach for another 2 while avoiding my supervisor! It was a full-on addiction to a subject I once hated (: I can't even begin to describe how much better my college experience has been because of this man. (:

"independence: a bunch of vectors are independent if there is no such combination among them that gives zero (other than all-zero combination).
reminder: pivots represent independent columns while free columns mean there is dependence.
a bunch of vectors C in a matrix A are independent when the nullspace of Ac =0 happens only when C is all zeros, a matrix of independent columns will have a rank = n (number of columns).
span: vectors v1...vl span a space when that space consists of combinations of those vectors.
basis of a space is a sequence of vectors v1...vd that are 1. independent 2. span that space
basis test:
n vectors of subspace Rn give basis if the matrix made from those vectors is invertible.
given a space (such as Rn) then every basis for that space has same number of vectors (n vectors), that is what we call ""Dimension"".
so for a space(n) we have a matrix A where rank(A) =  no. of pivot columns = dimension of space n" yjBerM5jWsc "9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 13606.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

"This instructor makes the subject over-complicated by burying the student in unnecessary details. The solution of the 2X2 example can be found in 3 to 5 minutes. The 3X3 example will take a little longer, but maybe the instructor needs to dazzle the students to justify making the class longer.
Take the first equation:                                     2x    - y = 0
Add the second equation multiplied by 2:    -2x + 4y = 6
Add them together:                                            0x + 3y = 6  dividing by 3, we get y = 2.
Inserting the value of y into the first equation:  2x  -2 = 0  and add 2 to both sides we get:  2x = 2
                                                                                                                                                            or  x = 1
For the second equation:                                    -x + 2y = 3, so:   -x + 2(2) = 3  or   -x + 4 = 3  
 Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:                                                                      -x = -4 + 3  or -x = -1
So,                                                                                                                                      x = 1
Final solution:  y = 2, x = 1.  DONE.

Actually, since the earth is not flat and roughly spherical, if the blocks stack up to high enough scales, the blocks would need to cover the arc length of the circle (along which the blocks are run on the earth) and that arc length increases linearly with the radius from the center of the Earth;

"I think the constraint made the system have only 2 degrees of freedom. Cause if Det=0 then the matrix is not Linearly Independent. Therefore: 
2x=λy, 2y=λx and xy=3 have only 2 L.I. equations. If Det=0.
This means if λ is a real unknown and x is an unknown, and y is an unknown, the equations is unsolvable if you only have 2 L.I. equations. 

3 unks with 2 L.I. equations, only becomes solvable when the constraint gave the system only 2 degrees of freedoms. Allowing you to solve for λ.

"At t = 21:00, Strang covers the definition of inversion (and at 32:00 he gives an example): first suppose A is an n x m matrix. Then if you have a left inverse L that acts on A, it will produce an identity matrix, call it I_n; similarly, If you have a right inverse R, when A acts on R it will also produce an identity matrix, call it I_m. So a Matrix is non-singular (sometimes mistakenly called regular) only if  m = n, A is square, and det(A) (does not) = 0. In particular, if the matrix A have full rank = n, all its columns and rows would be independent, so A would be invertible." FX4C-JpTFgY "3.

"I found this lecture quite confusing.  His last example of computing (AB)C vs A(BC) is the key idea.  The blog article he talks about I think misses the main computational point because it focuses on the composition of 2 functions and there is little computational advantage between forward vs. backward with only two functions.  

In case it might help others, here is how I think about it: Say everything is linear but the variables have different dimensions:
F(x)=F3(F2(F1(x))
start with variable x (input layer)
h1=F1(x) = Cx (hidden layer 1)
h2=F2(h1)=B*h1  (hidden layer 2)
y=F3(h2)=A*h2 (output layer)
Then F(x)=A*B*C*x and jacobian(F)=A*B*C
Forward differentiation first computes derivatives of h2 wrt x by multiplying jacobians (JF2)*(JF1).  Then finds derivative of y wrt x by multiplying by JF3 --> so this is A*(B*C)
Backward differentiation first computes derivatives of y wrt h1 by multiplying jacobians (JF3)*(JF2).  Then finds derivative of y wrt x by multiplying by JF1 --> so this is (A*B)*C

In a neural network, you might have x very large N-dimensional input (pixels in an image), hidden layers h1 and h2 with a moderate n-number of dimensions, and output y a scalar (probability the network thinks image is a cat).
So forward differentiation computes A*(B*C) -> cost is 1*n*N + n^2*N
backward differenations computes (A*B)*C costs 1*n^2 + 1*n*N" lZrIPRnoGQQ "27. Backpropagation: Find Partial Derivatives" "MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning, Spring 2018" 5433.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

hey, do you understand the first part when he stated that ( d/dx +x ) y = 0, translates to dy/dx +xy = 0? 

I'm a little confused about that. i see from the first equation that was a give that dy/dx = f(x) = y. Therefore y should equal dy/dx, so shouldn't the equation be (d/dx)(dy/dx) = -xy?

"To all those who didn't exactly got why dr/ds=(u hat), try understanding this way of explanation:
In the X-Y plane lets just take R(r vector) to be the position vector of a point in X-Y plane. Now if we move a length ds along u vector(U), the position vector of the point will change by amount dR. Thus, if you draw a picture of what I just said, you will understand this that,                                                                                                                                                             (R +dR) - (R) = (ds)(U hat).

Professor Strang said {(1,1,2),(2,2,5),(3,3,8)} makes a basis for R^3, but can't that set of vectors only produce vectors where x1 and x2 are equal? So you cant get (1,0,0) from the vectors and certainly not the entirety of R^3, right? The first and second row would even be the exact same written as a Matrix, so they should be linearly dependent for that reason as well.

"I see that they jump right into max and min, the hessian, etc after this...


do they cover this topics on this class??

limit and continuity for multiple variable functions
diferential calculus of multiple variable functions(things like, directional derivatives, supirior order partial derivatives C1 class, c2 class, etc...,Scharwz theorem,chain rule)
inverse and implicit theorems of multiple variable functions


beacouse in my multiple variable calculus class.  firts I had the review of vectors, parametrics ecuations and all of that, then I had topology and then the list of the thing I listed above(where I am currently in) and after that I´m going the have max and min, lagrange and with that I finish half of my calculus class, after I will see multiple variable integral calculus and after that to finish the course vectorial calculus(green, stokes and all of that)

so do this course cover that??? and if not wath should I be looking for?" UYe98CcxPbs "Lec 9: Max-min problems; least squares | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007" "MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007" 5959.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

Lo correcto es ""(curl F)·n"" donde n=(0,0,1) o ""(curl F)·k"", es decir, hacer el producto punto del rotacional del campo F con el vector normal al plano. Esa notación es mejor, puesto que es la que se usa después en el teorema de Stokes.

Mi punto es, no se realiza una integral de una función vectorial (Integral de flujo) sobre la superficie R, sino una integral de una función escalar, misma que proviene del producto punto del rotacional del campo (curl F) y el vector normal al plano: k.

"Awesome! I could watch the lectures over and over and each time, I gain a different and extra insight into the results and the process. Linear Algebra could turn into magic after you apply it’s theory—-the once dull computations of rows and columns. The most fascinating aspect of linear Algebra is when the entire matrix details unfold into a single effect, one that resembles the effect of simple scalars used in simple math formulas. Thanks to the fundamental concept of the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues. Understanding the very essence of a matrix and what it does to any vector quantity (change in magnitude and direction) is the key concept to appreciating the underlying concept of various matrix decompositions. It all boils down to how many ways we could see the workings of a matrix in terms of its decomposed forms. The SVD composition is one of those decompositions of a matrix that allows a matrix to be seen as a sequential transformation of direction and magnitude in terms of some orthonormal basis characteristic of such matrix and its Eigenspace.

This length is the diameter of the horizontal slice containing the focus of the parabola.
The formula for the volume of the paraboloid is actually:
(Pi a^2 k)/2
where k is the length in the parabola, therefore a volume is obtained and the units match up.

"At around the 21 minute mark, he says that it’s too much to hope for to reduce the matrix A0 to an upper triangular matrix. He immediately follows up with a statement that it’s impossible to solve a 5x5 system with simple steps. And this is why you instead reduce A0 to an upper Hessenberg matrix instead.

I got lost trying to follow this argument, so I did a bit of research.  Can someone tell me if I've got it right:
1) The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are just its diagonal elements.
2) The Abel-Ruffini theorem says that's impossible, using radicals, to find the roots of a 5th order polynomial.
3) If you were to try to solve det(A - lambda I) = 0 for a  5x5 triangular matrix, you'd be trying to find the roots of a 5th order polynomial. Though doesn't it automatically come perfectly factored for you to read off the eigenvalues?

Combining all of these, does the Abel-Ruffini theorem imply that you can't transform a 5x5 matrix into triangular form via orthogonal transformations (e.g. Householder reflections) which preserve the eigenvalues?  This doesn't sit right with me, so I'm thinking that can't be it." d32WV1rKoVk "12.

"Wonder why do we need to differentiate a function just to find the slope between two x values
whereby x is acted as parameter to the function f(x)..
We can find gradient by simply do
f(x)-f(x-1)
so this guarentee over one unit of x you get gradient..
Also it does not make sense to find gradient between two units of x..
For example consider f(x)=x²
to find gradient simply do
f(5)-f(4)
or anything like that as long it is f(x)-f(x-1)..
In this example we will get 25-16=9
So the gradient of the tangent line that intersects x=4 and x=5 is 9..
If you use differentiation f'(x)=2x+c
Let say you neglect c for a second..
And plug into the formula
At f'(5)=2(5)
Which is equivalent to 10
But this is incorrect..the correct value is 9
so now we know c=-dx
So if you want to find gradient between two units of x you get c=-2
which means f'(x)=2x-2
So I don't think finding the gradient between two units of x is relevant and so why not just use f(x)-f(x-1)
to find the gradient when x only incremented by one unit not more and not less" 7K1sB05pE0A "Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007" "MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006" 11981.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

"I have seen a lot of videos on the internet mostly through YouTube regarding random variables,  binominal, polinominal and multinominal random distributions.  I've seen several vids of this teacher and considering myself a guru on this particular subject, all I can say is that his approach, when it comes to teaching, is not the most adequate. To much theory and very few practical and clear examples. Being myself a college graduate and having the experience of knowing all lot of teachers, normally these kind of theorists are the ones who know less. They hide themselves in all this theory to try to disguise there lack of teaching capacity. Don't get me wrong, as theorists they're very good. Their lecture is very detailed and well studied. It's almost like you're hearing a recorder or a machine repeating the same thing over and over and over. Normally these kind of teachers won't even admit any sort of questions while the ""recording"" isn't finished playing (these are the worst kind). Even if you try to ask a question, anything out of the norm would cause discomfort, almost causing the ""machine"" to short-circuit. It's noticeable that he has a foreign accent. Maybe he doesn't feel very comfortable with his English and that's why he gives his lectures/classes the way he does. I don't know. I think I actually saw a video of this teacher in mutinominal distribution video where he actually says something like ""the multinominal distribution is a NICE generalization of the binominal distribution""?!?!? ""Nice generalization""?!?!?!?  When your teaching or talking about maths there is no place for words like ""NICE"". When you're teaching mathematics try to be OBJECTIVE . No wonder I have seen several videos of this guy and almost not a single practical case with a final answer.

"Abstract
A growing lattice with a label system of growth in every direction from the centre to infinity 
whole numbers for measuring size in connection to the size of the lattice label to size and size 
of the knot so that you can solve a measure from the knot size and size from the label in three 
dimensions to help solve Euler Brick problem?

remember the difference between a label and a size.

I will show each three slices of the lattice.
slice one centre is 0L0 this is the middle of space x,y,z
0L0 is a label and it has size as well its size is the knot size.
L is not just a label knot it has size as well.


rule for this lattice
A=B
pick size of gaps in lattice 20mm
pick size of knots L in my lattice is a squares diaginal = 10mm
example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
example of lattice

slice 0 centre 0L0 and centre of lattice

 2L0  2L0  2L0  2L0  2L0
 1L0  1L0  1L0  1L0  1L0
 0L0  0L0 (0L0) 0L0  0L0
-1L0 -1L0 -1L0 -1L0 -1L0
-2L0 -2L0 -2L0 -2L0 -2L0

slice 1 centre 0L1 but not centre of whole lattice

 2L1  2L1  2L1  2L1  2L1
 1L1  1L1  1L1  1L1  1L1
 0L1  0L1 (0L1) 0L1  0L1
-1L1 -1L1 -1L1 -1L1 -1L1
-2L1 -2L1 -2L1 -2L1 -2L1

slice -1 centre 0L-1 but not centre of whole lattice

 2L-1  2L-1  2L-1  2L-1  2L-1
 1L-1  1L-1  1L-1  1L-1  1L-1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


so a point on the lattice
example = 0L0 

so the lattice is infinite in every way so a line will look like this.

example y = 0L0 + 0L0 + 0L0 = 20mm*3 = y this line on the lattice
so a 60mm line.

example x = 0L0 + 1L0 + -1L0 = 20mm*3 = x this on the lattice so a 60mm line.

the hard point is a diagonal line 
example = 0L0 + -1L0 + 1L0 + (Knot=1 whole and 2 halves of a knot)
so 60mm because A=B so (0L0 + -1L0 + 1L0) = 60mm + knots

now a square
example =  1L0  1L0  
                    0L0  0L0  
                     
 
example =       1L0   1L0   1L0
                         0L0   0L0   0L0
                        -1L0  -1LO  -1L0  



now a cube

   1L1   1L1   1L1          1L0   1L0   1L0           1L-1     1L-1     1L-1
   0L1   0L1   0L1          0L0   0L0   0L0           0L-1     0L-1     0L-1
  -1L1  -1L1  -1L1         -1L0  -1LO  -1L0          -1L-1    -1L-1    -1L-1

"Reply to a question below on why we care about the 4 fundamental subspaces in the study of Ax=b: 

In professor Strang words (not in this lecture) ""understanding the four fundamental subspaces elevates the understanding of Ax=b to a vector space point of view, specifically, to to a vector subspace level of understanding""

It will pay off when learning different types of matrix factorizations, for ex, Single Value decomposition, SVD, where A=U∑V^T.  Where U is composed of orthonormal vectors in the row space, V of orthonormal vectors in the Column Space,  ∑ by the diagonal matrix of the squares of the singular values.

Similarly,  all other matrix factorizations QR, Q(LAMBDA)Q^T, etc benefit from their description in terms of subspaces.
This understanding/insight is super powerful, even critical, in Optimization,Machine Learning,  ill posed problems, etc 

Plz don't disregard this Vector Subspace approach, it's only apparently that it doesn't seem to shine when being learnt for the first time, but believe me, it's pure gold, and the clarity with which  Professor Strang explains it is invaluable

"hmmm... this is interesting.I never had it in school that you cannot integrate the function exp(-x^2) analytically .
And then I solved some similar integral, of  exp(-x^3/3)... and got an answer and wondered why everybody told me this cannot be solved. Nope. You actually can.  Here is the solution of  the integral of exp(-x^2) :
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integral+of+exp%28-t%5E2%29+from+-inf+to+x
the integral is 1/2*sqrt(pi)*(erf(x)+1)
which you actually can get by yourself also with the definition of incomplete gamma functions and integration by parts. You just have to know the incomplete gamma functions. and substitute -x^2 by -t. If you do that you get and integral that is almost the very definition of the incomplete gamma function. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function


It seems you have to be precise what you mean with analytic. analytic is all trigonometric functions and exp plus some sqrt and all their possible combinations....
Gamma functions and all kind of other integrals not included.

So no need to integrate this one numerically if you have incgamma or erf at hand. And I guess there is a reason why you call it error function. And neither do you need tables anymore

This is one example where analytic math has sort of stopped before the incomplete gamma funciton and other integral defined functions and a like have been invented. I guess this is actually a case where people would vigorously disagree just because they learned it otherwise without defining precisely what means actually analytic in this case.

I always wondered why on earth people think it until I came across this video by a german prof actually shading a little light on it. It seems this is only due to the historic definition of analytic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6w868U8C-M
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(differential_algebra)

 For an enghineer I would say this statement doesnt really make sense. Anyhow calculating gammas and gammainc functions, also hypergeometric functions is another story in itself, especially when multiplying special functions like exp and erf with each other to get them, that much I remember from calculating something also called F1.

Anyway... incomplete gamma functions are already seriously cool. Since you can calculate them within standard math libraries and they are the general case of many other special funcitons like error function, exponential integral, I think even airy. For many solutions of variable coefficient second order odes it was useful in many cases.

"I absolutely hate Taylor Approximations. I just spent an hour obsessing over how he did the calculations in the last five minutes or so. My mistake was that I thought he was approximating the entire X and Y functions while he was just approximating sine and cosine. I got the same result either way but I hated to see my numbers not match his.

Anyway, I think I'm finally beginning to feel the effect of not actually being in the classroom with him. I bet he assigns homework and the students get lots of practice with the concepts we don't actually see. I'm not complaining because they're being generous just making this much open source. But it really comes out. He asks the questions on the board and gives them some time to come up with answers and the amount of time he gives them is not enough time for me to solve it. (But I've got a handy dandy pause button). 

I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually missing the homework problems.

Shaq is 7'1, and according to above argument, his height is just 177 cm, seems like a normal person. In reality, his height is 216 cm, which is very huge.

Do i blame the professor? No. He gave a great lecture. I think it's just a slip of his mind. As a professor, i suppose he does work with meter system, which caused him to think 6 feet = 60 inches, which is very natural for those who don't use the retarded system (like the rest of the world). 

Can any American answer the following question in 1 second?
""131.4 feet = how many inches?""

"I think this could act as a proof of min 18:15 claims: 
* for the degenerate case, we have a line ( x + b / (2a) * y ) = 0 for wich z is allways 0 . It acts like the case of z = x^2 but rotated ( because the term affecting  y^2 is zero in the deg. case ).
* for the opposite signs (saddle): if we fix y=0 and let x increase we get possitive values but if we move for the line ( x + b / (2a) * y ) =  0  (the same as for the deg case) we get a decrease in the z values. (because y^2 is positive and the term affecting it is negative for saddle point case).
For the conditions of the exercise we start moving from (0,0) and the signs from above are in the case ( 1 / 4a ) is possitive (so change if negative).

Gravity's value is 9,8m/s^2, not 10m/s^2. Hence, the equation is h = 80 - 4,9 t^2 (4,9 is half the acceleration - gravity in this case), and not h = 80 - 5 t^2 as shown. How can a MIT teacher say it's 10m/s^2?
The formula the student asked for is: y = y(initial) + v(initial)t + 1/2 at^2. 
y= position (y at ground level, y(initial) at the top)
v= velocity (zero at the top)
a= acceleration (gravity in this case)
t= time
Acceleration assumes a negative value because you're heading down in the y axis.

This makes perfect sense if you logically think about the centre of mass and considering the block sitting on the bottom.

"I have watched lectures 14, 15, 16 over and over again, and gain new insights each time. Professors, including mine at the university, tend to drop the arrow sign above vectors while writing on the board. This causes great confusion for the uninitiated. For example, in this lecture there is an expression ""p=ax"" whether the writing ""ax"" means a (a scalar) times x (a vector) or a (a vector) times x (a scalar) is not that obvious. Admittedly, the confusion stems from my ignorance of the commutative property of scalar multiplication of vectors, which is, in fact, not mentioned explicitly in most textbooks (e.g., Lay et al, ; Larson & Hostetler). In retrospect, this ""p=ax"" notation is a prelude to the ingenious way of introducing projection matrix, which again, requires pre-knowledge of associative laws.

"For everyone asking about the bowl and eigenvalues analogy:
 Let X= (x,y) be the input vector (so that I can write X as a vector) and consider the energy functional f(X)=X^t S X. What would happen if we evaluate on the eigenvalues?
First, why would I think to do this? The eigenvectors of the matrix give the ""natural coordinates"" to express the action of the matrix as a linear transformation, which then gives rise to all the ""completing the square"" type problems with quadratic forms in usual LA classes. The natural coordinates rotate the quadratic so it doesn't have off-diagonal terms. This means the function changes from something like f(x,y)=3x^2+6y^2+4xy to something like f(x,y)=(x^2+y^2)=(||X||^2), where ||X||^2 denotes the squared norm. So the functional looks like a very nice quadratic in this case, like the ones you may learn how to draw in a multivariate calc course. 
Going back to the current calculation which f(X)=X^tSX: if we evaluate in the eigen-directions, then our function becomes f(X_1)=X_1^t S X_1=X_1 lambda_1 X_1= lambda_1 ||X_1||^2 (a nice quadratic) and 
f(X_2)=X_2^t S X_2=X_2 lambda_2 X_2= lambda_2 ||X_2||^2 (another nice quadratic). The eigenvalues lambda_1, lambda_2 become scaling coefficients in the eigen-directions. A large scaling coefficient means we have a steep quadratic and a small coefficient means we have a quadratic that is stretched out horizontally.
 If the eigenvalue is close to zero, the quadratic functional will almost look like a horizontal plane (really, the tangent plane will be horizontal) and hence not be invertible, so any solver will have difficulty finding a solution due to infinitely many approximate solutions. Since the solver will see a bunch of feasible directions, it will bounce around the argmin vector without being able to confidently declare success. Poor solver. Of course, these are purely mathematical problems; rounding error will probably mitigate the search even further.

"Dear Prof. Strang, it is actually very easy to visualize a saddle point. x/|x| is an ort that is fully defined on a 3D spherical surface that can be projected on any 2D plane without loosing any info. Choose (u,0,w). Any point within the unity circle represents the 2D ort. Zero radius (0,0) -> (0,0,1) . Then you plot R(u,w) = R(u,v,w) provided u^2+v^2+w^2=1; i.e. v=sqrt(1-u^2-w^2); You will see max =5 at (1,0), min=1 at (0,1) and 3 at (0,0)." 2K7CvGnebO0 "19.

It amazes me that some people feel that there's a need to do 10 whiteboards worth of derivations in a 50 minute course when the focus should ALWAYS be on the concepts, with the professor encouraging students to look up the derivation or the individual proofs. It's good that the professor managed to do the derivation at the end, cos it just reinforces the concepts and also provides a general methodological framework which students can then use to solve general problems." 7K1sB05pE0A "Lec 1 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007" "MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006" 5668.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

"I must say that I have been very disappointed by this lecture series so far. I am already familiar with single variable calculus. However, I am watching this series to review for some future classes (things like multivariable calculus and real analysis). 

However, here are some things I have noticed. Would that this instructor had spent some more time on the more rigorous concepts of limits and squeeze theorem, he would not have had to spend so much time trying to justify the proofs of the main two limits of this lecture. In addition to this, his students would be better prepared for future mathematics. As it stands, these students are really at a loss when it comes to their future.

I would really hope that instructors learn from this. Spend more time on the things you need to rigorously justify your claim: the foundations. If the ideas are glossed over, then everyone loses. Students don't understand why something is true, and so they become convinced that what the professor is doing is some kind of witchcraft that makes no sense.

then, (P2)(E2)(P1)(E1)(A) = (U2)
then, (P3)(E3)(P2)(E2)(P1)(E1)(A) = (U3)

"I know this doesn't have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.
 
1. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
2. Do you think there is an afterlife? 
3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? 
4. Do you think you are good enough to get into heaven?
 
No one is good enough to get into heaven. Here are a few questions to test your goodness: 
 
1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? 
2. Have you ever stolen? 
3. Have you ever used God's name in vain?
4. Jesus said that ""whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"" (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust? 
5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? 
6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?
 
The Bible says that ""all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone"" (Revelation 21:8) and ""Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn't have to go to Hell? 
 
2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God's law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. 
 
What you have to do is repent, or turn toward God, and believe in Jesus Christ. Don't trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus. 
 
When are you going to do that?

"Probably, this has been said before, so forgive me if I repeat someone else's words. 

I acknowledge here, that professor Strang is a good pedagogue. I learnt some math over the years. I completely support the use of the geometrical visualization of some properties, as it is a learning need. I can say that for me it is easy to see how to derive properties like the one he gave for the assignment on the Frobenius norm. I say this, because I may not be the only one thinking it and I wanted to tell those people that there is more to math here. 

Only recently, I understood the huge degree of humility and teaching wit that it takes one to pass one's knowledge along. It requires to pretend or to honestly feel you are no better than any of your students. For instance, as I could witness here, Pr Strang shared with his students the latest cool research topics as if they were his colleagues, he thanked them for contributing to the course by giving out some answers. That's what allows him to successfully challenge them in solving some assignments, like the Frobenius norm - SVD problem. All of it is summarized by Gilbert himself at the very end in 48:12, when he explains his view of his relationship with the students (such as ""We have worked to do!"", an honest use of the pronoun ""we"" by the lecturer). 

This 48 min long lecture, honestly impressed me in this regard. Today, I had the privilege of a double lecture: one in math (that could have been compressed to 15 min, since most proofs were skipped) and one in being a better passer of knowledge (that could be extended to 10+ years).

"For BPP, deep learning and for the general structure of neural networks the following comments may be useful. 

To begin with, note that instead of partial derivatives one can work with derivatives as the linear transformations they really are. 

It is also possible to look at the networks in a more structured manner. The basic ideas of BPP can then be applied in much more general cases. Several steps are involved. 

1.- More general processing units. 
Any continuously differentiable function of inputs and weights will do; these inputs and weights can belong, beyond Euclidean spaces, to any Hilbert space. Derivatives are linear transformations and the derivative of a neural processing unit is the direct sum of its partial derivatives with respect to the inputs and with respect to the weights; this is a linear transformation expressed as the sum of its restrictions to a pair of complementary subspaces. 

2.- More general layers (any number of units). 
Single unit layers can create a bottleneck that renders the whole network useless. Putting together several units in a unique layer is equivalent to taking their product (as functions, in the sense of set theory). The layers are functions of the of inputs and of the weights of the totality of the units. The derivative of a layer is then the product of the derivatives of the units; this is a product of linear transformations. 

3.- Networks with any number of layers. 
A network is the composition (as functions, and in the set theoretical sense) of its layers. By the chain rule the derivative of the network is the composition of the derivatives of the layers; this is a composition of linear transformations. 

4.- Quadratic error of a function. 
...
——-
Since this comment is becoming too long I will stop here. The point is that a very general viewpoint clarifies many aspects of BPP. 

If you are interested in the full story and have some familiarity with Hilbert spaces please google for papers dealing with backpropagation in Hilbert spaces. A related article with matrix formulas for backpropagation on semilinear networks is also available. 

For a glimpse into a completely new deep learning algorithm which is orders of magnitude more efficient, controllable and faster than BPP search in this platform for a video about deep learning without backpropagation; in its description there are links to a demo software. 

The new algorithm is based on the following very general and powerful result (google it): Polyhedrons and perceptrons are functionally equivalent. 

For the elementary conceptual basis of NNs see the article Neural Network Formalism.

"The meat begins at 12:00.
05:30 Errr, no, the square is not ""made of"" points. It *contains* those points. A point just marks a certain location inside that (pre-existing) square. One _cannot_ build the area of the square from points, because POINTS DON'T HAVE ANY AREA BY THEMSELVES!!! Areas could be made only from smaller (e.g. unit) areas. Otherwise there would be no difference between a scalar, a vector, a pseudovector, and a pseudoscalar in Clifford Algebras etc. There's a reason we distinguish those dimensions, right? :P
The ridiculousness of that statement comes out nicely at 06:10 where he writes the sum of the probabilities for these points. He said in the previous lecture that the probability of a point is 0 (because it has no area, and we assumed that area = probability in this model), and he restated this assumption again in this lecture here. So we're actually *adding up 0s here*! And we _cannot_ get a positive result (in this case: 1) from summing up zeros, no matter how much of them we add up (be it 10, 100 or infinitely many). So the right side of this equation cannot be equal to the left side, and the entire equation is false.
06:40 No, the mistake is not in this point. The union is fine, as long as we're adding up actual areas. The mistake is in assuming that a point can have an area :P
07:20 Of course I can! Cantor's diagonalization argument is one example. Another one is Hilbert's space-filling curve. Long story short: yes, there are ways of ordering points on a surface, as well as in space, by threading them on a line. In other words, there exist functions which map points on a surface (or in space) onto a line. And this is another proof that this is not what is wrong with this argument. The ""points have area"" assumption is.
17:20 If the probability of B is 0, then we're contradicting ourselves, because the ""|B"" in ""P(A|B)"" was supposed to mean that B occurred *for sure*. So it _cannot_ be 0! The very statement that ""B occurred"" means that this probability is _not_ 0, and we are OK to put it in the denominator. Logic, Mr. Titskills :P" TluTv5V0RmE "2.

"I used this to self-learn Vector calculus in my summer finishing year-1 of basic Multi-Calc in college starting from Lesson-15 to Lesson-29. I also made use of Schaum's Vector Analysis for problems and SJ Colley's Vector Calc as an additional reference. I watched all vids in at min 1.25x finishing it up in 2 weeks time.
 
Dennis Auroux is an absolutely delight and his board-rubbing skills are sooo impressive! His explanations are spectacular & I really enjoyed his emphasis on applications (particularly from physics-inertia, maxwell's eqns etc).

One thing I missed was lack of info on the Frenet-Serret Equations which I found awesome in general & the lack of practicing more problems but hey, you could do both on your own like I did!

Anyways, 12 years after this vid has been released, I'd still recommend this course with all my heart. It is awesome!

"Intuitively, a positive definite matrix is one that has more stretching weight than a rotation weight. If it operates on a vector in the first quadrant, it guarantees that the output vector is also in the first quadrant. This is almost like a closure property under the transformation of a matrix. I need to examine the case when the x vector in Ax is not in the first quadrant. The entire underlying theme is creating something that is very close to an Eigen matrix with more weight around the diagonal. The important of Eigen matrices is well known in applications where the power matrix has the same effect of a power scalar function. With big matrices, there is nothing more valuable than decomposing a matrix in terms of simpler matrices among which the Eigen matrix is one of those decompositions. Diagonalizing a matrix and SVD is very related to this theme. Any analysis that attempts to transform the effect of a matrix to one that resembles a scalar transformation is the goal." vF7eyJ2g3kU "27.

"Regarding the problem at 26:28
It would be solved if the matrix U was [1 0; 0 -1]. (Replace the 1 at the bottom right of the 2x2 identity with -1).
This can be found by following the argument that Prof Strang makes in this video: https://youtu.be/rYz83XPxiZo?t=1177 (Skip to 19:37).  
The problem is that here the eigenvectors of U that we found are [1, 0]' and [0, 1]', but they should be [1, 0]' and [0, -1]'.
The negative in the 2nd eigenvector allows the scaling term (sigma) to be strictly positive.  

Let S = Sigma (for ease of typing).
I think the main problem is that the general form A = U*S*V' does not mathematically enforce that S should be a strictly positive matrix.
So even though A'A and AA' will output the squares of the eigenvalues, simply choosing the positive roots is not enough.
We would need to choose the right sign for the eigenvector that corresponds to the positive root. E.g. [1,0] and [-1,0] can both have the same eigenvalue, so we have to decide which to use.
Hence, we need to check the cases and manually negate the vectors in U or V so that S can be positive.
However, if we follow what Prof Strang does in the video whose URL ive included in the earlier part of this comment, then this is accounted for by the computation." TX_vooSnhm8 "29. Singular Value Decomposition" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 8543.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

"Conclusion: A set of orthonormal vectors combine into a matrix called Q. Q'Q always get an identity matrix. If Q is square, it's an orthogonal matrix, and Q'=Q^(-1). If we use Qx=b instead of Ax=b to solve the projection problem, it will be much easier. Because the projection matrix P=Q(Q'Q)^(-1)Q'=QQ'.
For the A'Ax=A'b problem, if we use Q instead of 'A' we can simplify it as x hat equal to Q'b. 
Gram-Schmidt method: A way to transform independent column vectors into orthonormal basis.

"This problem has been over-flogged by the learned Prof. The simple answer (from linear algebra standpoint) is the projection of the origin onto the multilinear SET:  { Ax = b }.  This would almost always yield  the invertible matrix  A*At, such that the solution of: (A*At)y = b. Which you then plug into the given constraint to get:
x = At.y  which is the solution to the problem. A need not be a square matrix for all the respective dimensions to match. This particular form of the solution coincides with the projection of the point [ x = 0] onto the linear subspace: { x | Ax = b }. This is infact a trivial problem since we can project any other points e.g. x = (1, 2, 3,...., n ), onto { Ax = b } to arrive at yet another point on this subspace. This problem can also be viewed from linear analysis standpoint where the vector function: f(x,t) = ||x||^2 - t(Ax - b) is being minimized, wrt the vector x. And the same result is found. Cheers."

I don't get  why the result is 2(target-pred) * input1.
Is that because L2 is a squarefunction and the derivative of x^2 or error^2 is 2X , so 2error --> 2(target-pred), but then why the other parts of the formula disappear." lZrIPRnoGQQ "27.

However, at least in my experience this kind of lecture also has some psychological benefits, at least for some students, because they end up realizing they actually know most of the material.

"So if anyone is interested for an explanation of 38:00-38:31 roughly. x takes on values which are all the Natural numbers 1,2,3,4.... etc. Now if we want to find the probability values after some number of trials we'd obviously have to start after some variable, lets say 'n' amount of numbers. Expressing where we start by x, given the values that x takes would mean we'd have to write x+n whatever n is. In the video it is 1.

This implies that the expectation value given that x is all values greater than some n:
E[x|x>n]
notice how the specification of 'greater than n' is only nontrivial insofar as x takes on values from all the natural numbers. We specify this since we dont change the domain of values that x itself takes. Our problem would be solved if we just suggested that x take on values greater than n in itself, however we do not.

Now given this, we basically have to restrict the expectation values to when x>n, we'd have to start calculating expectation values at x+n. So suppose we start at the point n=5, ie. x is always greater than 5 (again, in the video it starts at n=1), then we'd do add 5 to natural number in x and thus we could attain the distribution we we're trying to attain by adjusting the random variables this way from the initial distribution.

In other words for any E[x+n] (note it is implicit here however this means E[x+n|initial sample space]).
This is a calculation of the expectation values of x greater than n.

We can express it in terms of the actual formula to make it more evident.
(x+n)p_X(x+n)=E[x+n] again, where x takes on the value of the natural numbers. Meaning that thus for every natural number from 1, we are adding n, making the formula apply on the values that are n greater than what would otherwise be in just E[x].

So as a consequence then E[x|x>n]=E[x+n|initial sample space]=E[x+n]." -qCEoqpwjf4 "6. Discrete Random Variables II" "6.041 Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability" 8770.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

Firstly, note that the free columns are linear combinations of the pivot columns (you can do some scribbling to confirm this).
This gives some intuition as to why we can allow the free columns to be scaled freely by    any number, then solving for the scalars of the pivot columns, such that you get zero column/vector if you add all these scaled columns. 
Pivot variables and free variables are the names for those respected scalars.

But by completeness of C, it says for every x , un(x) has a limit( isnt this uniform convergence in C)? and if so, doesnt that show uniform convergence in set of bounded continuous functions?

"45:12  Paraphrasing (and trying to cast it in the best light), here's what I heard:

Given a function whose derivative f'(x) exists at x0, prove that the function is continuous at x0.

1. By definition,  a function f(x) is continuous at the point x0 iff the lim as x->x0 of f(x) is equal to f(x0).
2. Stated equivalently, a function f(x) is continuous at the point x0 iff the [lim as x->xo of f(x)] -  f(x0)  is equal to zero.
3. So Let Z = [the lim as x->x0 of f(x)] - f(x0)  (and we'll see if we can get it to come out zero somehow).
4. Z = [the lim as x->x0 of f(x)]  -  [the lim as x->x0 of f(x0)].
5. Z = the lim as x->x0 of [f(x) - f(x0)].
6. Z = the lim as x->x0 of [f(x) - f(x0)] *  { [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)] / [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)] }.
7. Z = the lim as x->x0 of { [f(x) - f(x0)] / [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)] } *  [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)].
8. Z = the lim as x->x0 of { [f(x) - f(x0)] / (x-x0) } * [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)].
9. Z = f'(x0) * [lim x->x0 of (x-x0)].  (a critical step.  it removes the divide-by-zero conundrum.)
10. Z = f'(x0) * 0.
11. Z = 0.

Therefore, Given the existence of f'(x0),  which makes step 9 possible, the [lim as x->xo of f(x)] -  f(x0)  is equal to zero, and consequently the given function is continuous.

This is proof by demonstrating that the hypothesis plays an indispensable role in the conclusion.  Not my favorite method (by far!), but in the absence of a review of the algebra of absolute values and in the absence of an introduction of the epsilon-delta definition of a limit, I can't see how else the professor could have done it.

This course will be challenging to me in ways the authors never intended.  :)" ryLdyDrBfvI "Lec 2 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007" "MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006" 1250.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

"In the least-squares vs. PCA discussion that starts at 37:44, he's comparing minimizing sum of squares of vertical distances to minimizing sum of squares of squares of perpendicular distances.  However, each vertical error is related to each perpendicular error by the same multiplicative constant (cosine of the angle made by the estimated line), so in a way, minimizing one is tantamount to minimizing the other. Where the two methods do seem to differ is that least squares allows for an intercept term, while the PCA line goes through the origin.  However, when we look at the estimate of the intercept term (  b_0 = mean(y) - b_hat*mean(x)  ), least squares appears to be performing a de-meaning similar to the first step in PCA.  In summary, I think we would need a more thorough discussion than we see in the video in order to conclude that least squares and the first principal component of PCA are different." Y4f7K9XF04k "7.

"I am lost with calculation for last question at 29:46 ... Probability of 11th toss being H, given that first 10 tosses are heads.. If I compute using conditional probability, it comes to be same as Probability of 11th toss being H (without any condition, previous question)

x1/y1 events when first coin is picked
x1 => 11th toss is H
y1 => first 10 tosses are heads
P(x1|y1) = P(x1 intersect y1)/P(y1)

Assuming first coin => P(x1 intersect y1) => probability that first 11 tosses are H => (0.9)^11
P(x1) = (0.9)^10 
Thus , P(x1|y1) = 0.9.. and multiple by 1/2 since we picked first coin.

on similar grounds P(x2|y2) = 0.1 * 1/2

final is 0.9*1/2 + 0.1*1/2 => 1/2   , which is same answer as previous question.. I might be missing something very basic.. please correct me if I am mistaken in my computation" 19Ql_Q3l0GA "3. Independence" "6.041 Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability" 5113.0 0.0 1.0 0.0

"Excellent lecture  -- very difficult material --- expert presentation.  Suggestion: let the students work out the mathematical manipulations, and emphasize the concepts in the lecture:  Yes, state the theorems, but then present lots of real world examples, such as weather data,  demographic data, economic data, especially cases where the data might be modeled in a variety of ways etc .  The point:  mathematical manipulations are relatively easy once you know the rules, but the ideas are subtle and (probably) can only be grasped/conveyed via examples.  Yes, the lecture had lots of simple examples expertly woven into the theory, but the emphasis was on the mathematical manipulations and not enough on the concepts.

"Conclusion: 1. To calculate Ax=0 in other words calculate the null space of A, we can use 'reduce row echelon form'  (rref) method.
2. The rank of A equal to the number of pivots or rows after reducing row echelon, notation as r.
The column of A equal to the number of variables, notation as n.
So n-r is equal to the number of free variables.
3. Consider the solution of Ax=0, if we calculate the reduced row echelon form of A consisting of [T F], the solution matrix will be the transform of [-F T], where T stands for identity matrix and F stands for free matrix.
The solution matrix would be n*(n-r) shape." VqP2tREMvt0 "7. Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions" "MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005" 3194.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

"Can someone help me? I don't have a good foundation for the details in math atm. I get the concepts really well, but I found something that doesn't make sense to me. When he is doing S (1-cos^2x)*sinx*cos^2x*dx = .... he adds the powers of cos^2x 's and makes it cos^4x. I tried pluging in numbers to see if this logic actually added up and it doesn't unless the base of the number with powers is 1. Is this because cos is considered 1 in some way? If I did 10^2 and 10^2... I get 10^4. lets say my formula is (1-10^2)*2*(10^2)*4=. well (1-100)*2*100*4 = -99*2*100*4 = -79200. But if I add those powers like so... (1-10^4)*2*4=-79,992. Doesn't add up. Anyone??? lol asking for a friend who knows what they are doing. I'm gonna go to school for this stuff but need to know what went wrong here.

"31:59 Basically, the reason why you can solve this problem, you can make a finite automaton which recognizes the language B, is because that finite automaton is going to keep track of the parity of the number of 1's
it's seen before. This has two states, one of them remembering that it's seen an odd number of 1's so far,
the other one remembering it's seen an even number of 1's before. And that's going to be typical for these automata,
finite automata. There's going to be several different possibilities that you may have to keep track of as you're reading the input, and there's going to be a state associated with each one of those possibilities. So if you're designing an automaton, you have to think about-- as you're processing the input-- what things you have to keep track of. And you're going to make a state for each one of those possibilities

"x+y+3z=5
is the equation of a plane ..
Then you find normal vector from that equation
which is perpendicular to the plane..
So maybe the equation of that normal vector is
x+y+3z=0
Then normal vector to the plane is
N=<1,1,3>
Then do dot product between N and Z
If it is 0 then it is perpendicular to N and thus Z is parallel with the plane x+y+3z=5
People might be mistaken ..
Ah just do dot product between Z and <1,1,3> ..ah it's 0 so it must be perpendicular to the plane x+y+3z=5
And doest not realized <1,1,3> the normal vector of plane x+y+3z=5..
I don't really understand this..
Because what does x+y+3z=0
Represents?
Is it perpendicular to x+y+3z=5?
It must be not true
Because the planes must be parallel to each other because the coefficient of x,y,z are similar

"Hot off the presses : We can pair every positive floating point number 
using up only about 20% of the integers 

Algorithm #1 : Convert a float with a zero whole part into an integer

1. Reverse the character sequence representing this float
2. Remove the decimal point to obtain the desired integer

Example :  Convert the float 0.002743 into its integer equivalent
1. Reverse the float string to obtain 347200.0
2. Remove the decimal point to obtain the integer 3472000 
3. Note : All corresponding integers will be terminated by the character  “0”

Algorithm #2 : Convert a float with a non-zero whole part into an integer

1. Count the number of whole digits or NWD (those preceding the decimal point ) 
2. Append a number of  “0” digits equal to NWD to the float. 
3. Append a digit “1”  to the resulting float
4. Remove the decimal point to obtain the desired integer

Example : Convert the float  1230.0098 into its integer equivalent 
1. Count the number of whole digits : NWD = 4
2. Append NWD = 4  “0” digits to obtain 1230.00980000
3. Append a digit “1”  to obtain 1230.009800001
4. Remove the decimal point : this gives us the final integer of 1230009800001

Note : We append a digit “1”  to distinguish the integers derived from floats with 
non-zero whole parts from integers generated by floats with zero whole parts .

This can be done for every  float [whole.fraction]  where whole  >  0  !!! AMAZING!!!

But if like me you've ever had trouble learning something at school/uni or needed extra material or just been keen to learn then you may have benefited from all the great lectures + content MIT OCW provides! So give back a little even if it's just a few dollars and share and convince others to give too. :)
