 All right. So last lecture, we concluded our discussion about measurable functions, I mean measurable sets. And remember our original motivation was that we're trying to build an integral that somehow surpasses the properties of that of the Riemann integral in that, you know, hopefully this larger class of functions that are integrable with respect to this integral form a Banach space as opposed to Riemann integrable functions. And we started off by, you know, asking the question, you know, how would we integrate the simplest types of functions which are just one on a set and zero off of it. And that led us to, you know, how to define measure. And so then we define Lebesgue measurable sets, prove that they form this special collection, type of collection of sets called the sigma algebra and that they contain, you know, a lot of sets, a lot of interesting sets, you know, open, closed, unions, countable unions of closed which are not necessarily closed, countable intersections of opens which are not necessarily open and so on. Now not every set is Lebesgue measurable. We will not go through that construction of a non-measurable set. The construction of this set or what it, how one obtains it also is kind of would provide a proof that we could not build a measure that's defined on all subsets of real numbers having this, these three properties that its translation invariant, the measure of an interval is the length of the interval and the measure of a disjoint union is the sum of the measures. But, you know, this is a functional analysis class. Our goal is to build up a Banach space of, you know, integrable functions so we needed to define a better notion of integrable than Riemann. I imagine in a measure theory class you would see such a construction but we won't cover that here. So in some sense if we built up measure we kind of know, you know, roughly speaking how we would integrate the simplest type of function which is one on a measurable set and zero off of it. Now what about, you know, what would be a method of trying to integrate more general functions? So this is I think, so now we're going to be talking about measurable, this is how it's spelled, measurable functions. So to motivate the definition of a measurable function let me just give a few minutes of, you know, why we introduced this definition, what's really behind it. So historically, you know, when Lebesgue thought of his theory of integration if we had a function on a closed interval AB and let me draw it, let's say it's, you know, just increasing. So what Riemann does of course is you partition up AB and then you form, you know, essentially a, you know, these boxes, these that have width given by how you've chopped up AB and height given by F, the function F evaluated at some point in those subintervals, right? And you form a Riemann sum and you take a limit. Yeah, and that gives you the Riemann integral. And so what Lebesgue thought of doing was instead of chopping up the domain, chopping up the range. So let's imagine, so this function is only this height so what he would do or what one would do is let's, and let's say we're just interested in integrating non-negative things, chop up the range and so on, you know, up to some finite point. And now how do you form, you know, your boxes if you like that you're going to take the size of? Well, you look at the piece of F that's in between a given partition and this portion of F will, okay, in this picture we'll call this point C. So then you take this portion of F that's in here and then AC would be given by is the set F inverse of in this picture and I'm just going to write it in this way, yi, yi minus 1 yi. And you could build up a box by now taking it to be the lower value y2 and having width given by, you know, A to C and I can actually do this because this is an increasing function so this will be, you know, an actual box. Now what am I getting at? And then you would say something like, you know, we would like to define the integral of F over AB. So this is all, you know, motivation, informal discussion, don't take this to heart too much. Then we would like to define the integral from AB to F to be somehow this limit and I'm not even going to write as something goes to 0 or infinity, you can think of as partitions get smaller of, you know, a sum now where I'm summing from i equals 1 to n of yi minus 1, so the lower part times now the length of, at least for this picture, so this would be the length of the interval given by F inverse of yi minus 1 yi. So this would be, you know, kind of an analogous procedure to what Riemann does on the domain except now focusing on the range. Now I wrote length here because this function I drew is, you know, increasing so the inverse image of one of these intervals is going to be another interval, so the length is meaningful but, you know, if F is more general, F inverse doesn't need to be of yi minus 1 yi. It need not be an interval and so, you know, taking its length would not be a meaningful thing but remember we now have this notion of measure, right, which should be the substitute for length for more general sets, measurable sets. So, you know, this procedure could still work if instead of this requiring that this is an interval requiring that this is a Lebesgue measurable set, okay, and then perhaps one could define the integral in this way. And there, you know, these kind of things would no longer be boxes but now so that should motivate why perhaps we should look at functions so that the inverse image of closed intervals is a measurable set so that we can take its measure and maybe do this procedure of defining an integral. Now, all of that is a bit, again, this is all informal discussion just meant to be motivation. In fact, in how we'll define the Lebesgue integral, we're not going to define it in this way because, you know, what this way of doing it suffers is it's not clear that this is, you know, independent of how I partitioned up the range, okay. So maybe if I take a limit as the partitions get smaller along some sequence of partitions, I get a different number from the other so that would have to be checked. But as we'll see when we do define the Lebesgue integral, this number, you can compute it by essentially this procedure I gave here where you chop up the range of F and take kind of approximations to F that are more general than just step functions which is, you know, what this is. You know, it's a function that's a given value off on an interval and then zero outside. And that'll be, you know, a way of seeing that this motivation, you know, connects to actually how we define the Lebesgue integral. But again, the whole point of what I'm saying is that or trying to motivate is that we should and at least historically this is why one considers these things, consider function so that the inverse image of closed intervals is measurable, okay? And that's sort of the motivation for measurable functions. Now, you know, as we saw when we were discussing, you know, what sets are measurable, you know, we didn't exactly conclude directly that, you know, closed intervals were measurable. We started with something kind of something a little more basic which was half, you know, half infinite intervals, proved those were measurable and then concluded that, you know, closed intervals are measurable, any interval is measurable. And so, you know, when we actually define measurable functions, we'll be using as input more of these half infinite intervals being measurable rather than this. So let's get to it. Let's define measurable function. So now, just comes with the territory but we're going to be considering extended real-valued functions in what we do. So I shouldn't have written that down, I should have written down extended real numbers. What does this mean? This just means the set of real numbers along with plus and minus infinity. So when I write the interval minus infinity, infinity, this is our union, you know, the two symbols plus or minus infinity. Now, you know, we're going to have expressions where we allow a function to take on the value plus infinity or minus infinity. So it should, we should set down, you know, what we mean when we multiply, you know, some of these things together. So sums are defined as X plus or minus infinity equals plus or minus infinity for all X and R. So if I have, you know, two extent, two functions which, you know, whose values could be in the extended real numbers and I have one is finite and the other is infinite, then I just by convention, their sum is defined to be plus infinity. But I'm not allowed to take infinity minus infinity or infinity plus minus infinity. So this and products are defined as we take the convention that zero times plus or minus infinity equals zero and I'll, you know, we won't come up against this until we discuss the integral, why we would need such expressions. But, you know, you could have a function that, let's say, identically equal to infinity, identically gives this symbol plus infinity. If I multiply that function by zero, then I should get zero. This has nothing to do with limiting processing though. These are purely algebraic expressions we'll be dealing with. I'm not saying that everything you learned in 18.100 real analysis about being careful when you have infinity over infinity or zero times infinity is, you know, I'm not saying throw that away. I'm just saying when we have certain algebraic expressions, these are the conventions that we adopt, okay? And x times plus or minus infinity equals plus or minus infinity for all x in R take away zero, okay? And let me just recall for you what it means for, you know, we'll have, be making some limiting statements about, you know, certain numbers approaching other numbers. So what would it mean to, for a sequence of numbers to approach plus infinity or minus infinity? I want you to recall that a sequence a n of real numbers converges to infinity and then you can make, you know, a similar definition for minus infinity if for every R positive there exists a natural number n such that for all n bigger than or equal to n, a sub n is bigger than R, okay? And I mean, I've been using something equals infinity already kind of when we've been discussing measure, you know, the outer measure of something being equal to infinity. But and what follows will be having expressions where we allow something to equal infinity and we'll have algebraic expressions of this type. So I just need to set down convention that if I have a real number plus or minus infinity that is by definition equal to plus or minus infinity. If I have zero times something that equals plus or minus infinity, then that is by convention equal to zero and so on, okay? All right. So, measurable functions, I said should be those functions at least motivated by this discussion before, those functions or the functions we're interested in are those functions so that the inverse image of closed intervals are measurable. So that's how we'll define measurable functions almost. I mean, an equivalent way which is a little bit easier to work with is the following. So let E be measurable set and F from E to the extended reals. Say F is Lebesgue measurable, that's new terminology. If for all alpha in R, if I take the inverse image of the half infinite interval alpha to infinity, this is measurable, I should say. We had some notation last time. The script M being the collection of measurable sets, i.e. is Lebesgue measurable, okay? So this is, as we'll see in a minute, this is an equivalent definition really of requiring that the inverse image of a closed and bounded interval is measurable. Or at least we'll see one direction of why that's equivalent and then in your own time, you can figure out why it's actually equivalent. Now, why not include alpha? Why do I have to look at the inverse image of this half open interval? And why am I going from alpha to infinity and not, say, alpha to minus infinity or include alpha there? Why this specific kind? And then so what I want to first tell you is that looking at those types of sets and seeing if those are measurable is equivalent to this definition that I'm giving here. So let's take a function from a measurable set E subset of R to the extended reals, then the following are equivalent. One is kind of the definition, the property that's in the definition of being measurable for all alpha in R, F inverse of alpha infinity is measurable. Two, for all alpha in R, F inverse including alpha is measurable. Three, for all alpha in R, the inverse image of minus infinity to alpha is measurable. And the last condition is for all alpha in R, the inverse image of now include alpha is measurable. OK, so to check what do you get from this, to check that a function is Lebesgue measurable, it suffices not to just solely prove this property or check this property. You can check it on other types of sets. It suffices to only check it, it suffices to check it on either these types of sets or these types of sets or these types of sets. So if you can prove that for all alpha, this type of set is, or the inverse image of these types of intervals are measurable, then it's equivalent to saying that F is Lebesgue measurable. OK. Now the proof is not hard based on what we know about Lebesgue measurable sets, which again we proved last time that they form a sigma algebra, they're closed under taking countable unions, intersections and complements and so on. So let's first prove that 1 implies 2. So I'm saying they're all equivalent, which means they should all imply each other. So let's first prove 1 implies 2. So suppose 1 holds, then for all alpha in R. Now I want to check that 2 holds, I can write alpha to infinity as the intersection over natural numbers n of alpha minus 1 over n infinity, which implies the great thing about taking inverse images is that they respect all operations you can do on sets. So the inverse image of any type of intersection is the intersection of the inverse images. And if I'm assuming each of these is measurable by 1, then this is a countable intersection of measurable, Lebesgue measurable sets. Again when I say what is the Lebesgue measurable sets, I'm talking about the inverse image of this set, not this set in here. I'm talking about the inverse image of this interval. So each of those is a Lebesgue measurable set, so their intersection is Lebesgue measurable. So and therefore for every alpha in R, the inverse image of these closed intervals are measurable. So and how do I show 2 implies 1 by a similar game? Suppose 2 holds, then for all alpha in R, the half open interval now I can write as the union over n alpha plus 1 over n to infinity. And therefore the inverse image of alpha to infinity is equal to the union of the inverse images of these sets. And again, if I'm assuming 2, then I'm assuming each of these for each n is a Lebesgue measurable set, and we know countable unions of Lebesgue measurable sets are again Lebesgue measurable, so this is Lebesgue measurable. So that proves 1 and 2 are equivalent. OK. And we sort of get 3 and 4. So first off, 2 is equivalent to 3 simply because if I take minus infinity to alpha, this is equal to alpha infinity complement. And therefore again, when I take inverse images and knowing that the Lebesgue, that the complement of a Lebesgue measurable set is Lebesgue measurable, I get that 2 is equivalent to 3 and 1 is equivalent to 4. Again, since I have this last type of set, minus infinity to alpha, this is equal to, so this is for all alpha in R, since for all alpha in R, this is equal to complement. So again, if I take the inverse image of this set, I will get the complement of the inverse image of this set. And if that's measurable, that inverse image is measurable, then its complement is measurable, implying that's measurable. So it's a simple game, or it's a simple proof just based on the fact that we know that Lebesgue measurable sets are closed under taking countable unions, intersections, and complements. So then we get the following theorem that if E is measurable, so E is a subset of R is measurable, and f from E to R is a measurable function. In the future, I will probably just say f is measurable, not a measurable function. Then for all f in the Borel sigma algebra, f inverse of f is measurable. The inverse image of f is measurable. So what's the proof? f measurable implies that for all a, b, a less than b, f inverse of the open interval a, b, which is equal to the f inverse of the two intersect equals f inverse of. So if I take the inverse image of this open interval a, b, then it's equal to the inverse image of this intersection, which is equal to the intersection of these two inverse images. And if I'm assuming f is measurable, then each of these sets, each of these pre-images are measurable. So by the previous theorem that I just proved, and therefore, that's measurable. So I've shown that open intervals are measurable. And similar to how we concluded that open sets are measurable, we use the fact that every open set, which you proved in assignment three, that every open set can be written as a union, accountable union of disjoint open intervals. Thus f inverse of u is measurable for all open sets, subsets of R. And since the set, let's call it a, which is the set of all f such that this is a. So you're also proving in the assignment this collection of sets such that the inverse images are Lebesgue measurable. This is a sigma algebra containing, since we've now proved that all open sets are in this set, this implies that the Borel sigma algebra, which is again the smallest sigma algebra containing all open sets, is a subset of this here, which is the statement of the theorem. And so let me just add on here another thing. So now we know that if we have a measurable function, it takes the inverse image of Borel sets, so sets that belong in the Borel sigma algebra are measurable. This includes all open sets. What about throwing plus or minus infinity into the mix? So if f goes from one measurable set e to R is measurable, then the sets, so let me write it this way, the inverse image of where f is infinite or minus equal to minus infinity, these are measurable as well. And how does one prove that? So proof, again, we could just use the definition of how this works and the fact that we know Lebesgue measurable functions or Lebesgue measurable sets are closed undertaking accountable intersections, unions, and complements. We have that f inverse of infinity, this is equal to the intersection overall n of f inverse, the inverse image of n to infinity. And if I'm assuming f is measurable, then each of these is a measurable set, the inverse image of n to infinity is a measurable set. I will often use inverse image or preimage. These are meant to be taken as saying the same thing. Each of these is a measurable set, so it's the accountable intersection of measurable sets is measurable, so that's measurable. And similarly, if I look at the set where it's equal to minus infinity, this is equal to the intersection of the inverse image of minus infinity to n. Let's say, let's take these positives, so then I'll put minus n here. And by this theorem that we just proved a minute ago, each of these, well, I mean, we just proved that the inverse image of Borel measurable or Borel sets are Lebesgue measurable, so well, that won't apply. Never mind, forget what I just said. The theorem we just proved a minute ago that Lebesgue measurable functions take sets of this type to Lebesgue measurable sets implies that each of these is Lebesgue measurable, and therefore, it's accountable union of Lebesgue measurable sets, so for all n. So that's measurable. OK, so if I have an extended real valued function, and the inverse image of every Borel set, you can even toss in the two infinities if you like, the inverse image of those sets is Lebesgue measurable. So in particular, we conclude that the inverse images of closed and bounded intervals is Lebesgue measurable for measurable functions. OK, now what are the simplest types? Again, you see a definition, you should ask for an example, what are the simplest types of measurable functions? So if f from R to R is continuous, then that implies that f is measurable. So in the end, when we build our definition of the Lebesgue integral, we should encompass Riemann integration as well. In other words, we should be able to also integrate continuous functions. And later we'll see, and something that we want as well is that the Lebesgue integral of a continuous function should reduce down to the Riemann integral of a continuous function. So at a minimum, when we're building these concepts, we should check as a kind of sanity check that we are including continuous functions in these possible functions which we will integrate. So if f is continuous, f is measurable, why is this? This is because for all alpha in R, if I look at the inverse image of alpha infinity, so first off, this is equal to this set, and this is an open set, so this is open. So the inverse image of an open set for a continuous function is open, and therefore is measurable. Right? OK. So how about a different example? Let's take a measurable subset E of R, let f be another measurable subset and define the indicator function chi of f of x to be 1 if x is in f, 0 if x is not in f. Then this function chi f, now if I think of it as being a function from E to R, this is measurable. OK? Now, why is that? Well, we can just compute if alpha is in R, if I look at the inverse image of alpha to infinity, this is equal to one of three things. Since chi takes on only the values 1 and 0, if alpha is bigger than 1, this is the empty set which is measurable if alpha is bigger than or equal to 1, since this set would not include 1. If alpha is between 0 and less than 1, then the inverse image of this set is equal to E intersect f. E is measurable, f is measurable, so their intersection is measurable. And if alpha is less than 0, then the inverse image of this set, in other words, what sets map into from 1 negative number to infinity, well, both 1 and 0 map into there, and that's the entire set E. OK? And so no matter what alpha is, the inverse image of that set is measurable. OK. So now let's, so these are basic properties of measurable functions. Let's continue. What would we like more? So what other properties of measurable functions, again, which we would hope to integrate or we will be integrating at least a class of these in the end, to satisfy, well, we would like them to be closed undertaking linear combinations and also products because in the end we'll have LP spaces, which is kind of products of integrals or products of integrable functions. So we have the following theorem. E is, so let's suppose E is measurable and I have two functions going from E to R that are measurable and I have a scalar in R. OK? Then C times F, F plus G, and F times G, so these are now all functions from E to R, are measurable, OK, are measurable functions. So what's the proof? Let's start with scalar multiplication. If C equals zero, then C times F equals zero, which is a continuous function, it's a constant function zero, is continuous, hence measurable. So let's suppose C is non-zero, so we're out of the silly case, OK? If C does not equal zero and alpha is an element of R, then C times F of X greater than alpha, this is equivalent to F of X is greater than alpha over C, so this implies that if I want the inverse image, if I look at C times F and I look at the inverse image of alpha to infinity, this is equal to the inverse image of, by F, of the set alpha over C infinity. OK? And now if I'm assuming F is measurable, then the inverse image of this set is measurable, so that's a measurable set, and therefore C times F is a measurable function. So now let's look at the function F plus G. Suppose alpha is in R, then let's do something kind of similar, then F of X plus G of X is greater than alpha, this is if and only if F of X is greater than alpha minus G of X. So I didn't say this, but when I'm looking at such a condition, I'm looking at those X's that will be in this inverse image. OK? So I'm just trying to figure out an equivalent way of expressing this condition, which we saw was this condition. So what I'm really looking at is those X's which would lie in this preimage here. OK? And what I did a minute ago was show it's equal to this preimage here. OK? So this is why I'm considering F of X plus G of X plus alpha. This is the condition that, so maybe I'll just write this out, then X is in this set if and only if F of X plus G of X is bigger than alpha, which is equivalent to F of X plus F of X is greater than alpha minus G of X. Now you learned in 18.100, A, B, P, Q, whatever, that if I have any two real numbers, one bigger than the other, then I can find a rational number in between them. OK? So if this number is bigger than this number, there exists a rational number R such that F of X is greater than R is greater than alpha minus G of X. OK? So this, assuming this, does imply this. And of course, this condition also implies this condition. If there exists a rational number so that F of X is bigger than R is bigger than alpha minus G of X, then of course, F of X is bigger than alpha minus G of X. So these two conditions are equivalent. So this is equivalent to saying there exists an R in Q such that X is in the inverse image of F, R to infinity, intersect and R is bigger than alpha minus G of X, which one can state as X is in the inverse image of alpha minus R to infinity. OK? So this last expression here, so let me come over here and start erasing. So we've shown that X is in the inverse image of this set, F plus G, the inverse image by F plus G of this set, if and only if there exists a rational number so that X is in the intersection of these two types of sets, which we know are measurable. Right? So we can express this or summarizing what we just found that F plus G inverse image of alpha infinity, this is equal to the union over rational numbers R and Q such that, or the inverse image of F inverse or the inverse image of R infinity intersect alpha minus R infinity. OK? So that's just, again, expressing what we did over there. And now what do we know if we're assuming F is measurable, then this whole set is measurable. And we're assuming G is measurable, so this whole set is measurable and therefore this intersection of these two sets is measurable. And now I have a countable union because, again, the rational numbers are countable. One of the first things you prove in analysis is that a set of rational numbers is countable. This is a countable union of measurable sets, so that's measurable. OK? OK. Now, what about F times G? Here we'll pull a little trick. So we'll prove that if F is measurable, then its square is measurable and then we'll use a simple identity to conclude that F times G is measurable. So now I claim that F squared is measurable. Let alpha be a subset of R. If alpha is bigger than or equal to 0, well, let's do kind of this stupid case first. If alpha is less than 0, then F squared, this is a non-negative function. So if I take the inverse image of alpha to infinity, this is just equal to the domain E, so this is measurable. OK? Remember, this is the set of all X's that get mapped by F squared to alpha to infinity. And if alpha is negative, then no matter what X is in E, F squared of X is going to be in alpha to infinity, again, for alpha less than 0. So this inverse image equals E, which is measurable by assumption. OK? All right. And then the other less trivial case is if alpha is bigger than or equal to 0, then, OK, F squared of X is bigger than alpha if and only if either, what, F of X is bigger than square root of alpha or F of X is less than minus square root of alpha. And therefore, so again, this expression here is, this expression is expressing, but this relation here is expressing X is in the inverse image of alpha to infinity. So this says that the inverse image of alpha to infinity is equal to the set of all X's satisfying this condition on the right of this if and only if, which can be written as X is in the inverse image of F is bigger than square root of alpha union, again, coming from the or, F inverse of, and again, if we have a measurable function, then not only are these types of, the preimages of these types of sets measurable, but the preimages of these types of sets are also measurable, right? That was the first thing we proved. And so since each of these preimages are measurable, their union is measurable, so that's measurable. Okay? So, we proved that F squared is measurable. Now we conclude that F times G is measurable by, by a simple identity that F times G, this is equal to 1 4th F plus G squared minus F minus G squared. Okay? So F times G is equal to this function squared. If F and G are measurable, their sum is measurable, and therefore by what we just proved, the square is measurable. And again, over here, this is going to be measurable. And by scalar multiple of minus 1, that thing's measurable. Scalar multiple 1 4th on the outside is, is fine as well. So we conclude that this thing is measurable. Alright? Because every operation in this expression preserves the function being measurable as, as we proved before this, before this expression. Okay? And that's, that concludes the proof. So the sum of two, you know, measurable functions is measurable, scalar products are measurable, products are measurable. You know, big deal, because as far as Riemann integration goes, as far as Riemann integration goes, that's a, you know, that's, that still holds. Right? So what's something that sets apart, you know, a function being measurable and, and, you know, eventually the vague integrable, is that it has better, you know, it's closed under taking limits as opposed to being Riemann integrable. So this is the following theorem. If I have a measurable set and then I have a sequence of functions, Fn, going from minus infinity to infinity. Oh, and so I should have said a minute ago, I'm just kind of catching myself. Oh no, everything's fine. So I just wanted to make sure I had gone to R because, you know, F plus G is only defined going from E to R. Okay? But again, if I have one function that is finite everywhere and another function that's an extended real valued function, you can check that F plus G is then going to be measurable as well. Okay? The, I can't make sense of, you know, the sum of two extended real valued functions because I might be in a situation where I have plus infinity minus infinity, which is an undefined expression. But what I'm saying is I can take for all of this for, you know, one of them to be extended real valued is fine and also the product of extended real valued is fine, although I left it out of the list of rules. Plus infinity times minus infinity is defined to be minus infinity and kind of with the usual sign rules. Okay. So back to the theorem. If I have a sequence of measurable functions, so then some other functions are measurable, then the function G1 of X equal to sup N FN of X. So that's now a function defined on E. This is also measurable. Then so I'll just list the functions and then say they're all measurable. G2 of X equals the M over N FN of X. Three of X equals lim sup as N goes to infinity of FN of X, which I will recall the definition you can write as the M over all N of the sup over all K bigger than or equal to N FK of X and four. So I don't know why I'm double labeling them. I have one, two, three, and four, but I also have one, two, three, and four here. And the lim inf of the point wise lim inf of these functions, which I will recall is equal to the sup over M of inf. These are all measurable functions. OK, so let's prove this. So the proof is not too difficult. So let's start with the first one. Actually the third and the fourth follow from the first and the second. So X is in the inverse image by G1 alpha to infinity if and only if, of course, sup N FN of X is greater than alpha, and this is equivalent to the sup over all N of FN of X is bigger than alpha if and only if there exists some N so that FN of X is bigger than alpha. Right? If all the FN stay below alpha when evaluated at X, then the sup is less than or equal to alpha. Right? So since the sup is the least upper bound. So if and only if there exists an N such that if and only if there exists an N so that X is an FN inverse of. OK? And therefore we've proven that the inverse image of this set by G1 is equal to the union over all N of F sub N inverse, the inverse image of alpha to infinity. And now we're assuming the FNs are all measurable. So each of these is measurable. It's a countable union of measurable sets. So it's, again, a measurable set. All right? So we've proven that for all alpha this is a measurable set. So G1 is measurable. Now if we go on to G2, it's the same thing. I can prove that the inverse image of. Let's see. What do I do here? Now I'm going to include alpha here. The inverse image of alpha to infinity. So this is equal to the requiring that the inf over FN of X is bigger than or equal to alpha. This is equivalent to the intersection now of F inverse of these guys. OK? Now each of these is, again, measurable by assumption. And therefore its countable intersection is measurable. OK? So we've proven that taking sups and infs of sequences of functions are measurable. But by how the lim sup and lim inf are defined, so now we've proven that for any sequence of measurable functions, the sup and the infs are measurable functions. But the lim sup is this sup first, followed by an inf. Now if all of the Fs are measurable, this sup is measurable for all N. And therefore this inf is measurable. So G3 being measurable follows immediately from proving that sups and infs of measurable functions are measurable. And the same thing with the lim inf. If F sub K is measurable for all K, then we've already proven that the infs over the Ks, bigger than or equal to N, doesn't matter, is measurable, a measurable function. And therefore the sup over the Ns of all these measurable functions are again measurable. So the fact that G3 and G4 are measurable follow from the expressions for and the previous two cases, meaning that we've proved infs and sups of measurable functions are measurable functions. Now what do we get from this? So an immediate theorem is the following. If E is measurable, Fn goes from and Fn is measurable for all N. And they converge point-wise to some function F of X, then F is measurable. I mean I shouldn't write it as a theorem, I should write it as a corollary. Why? Because if these converge, then F is equal to the lim sup. It's also equal to the lim inf, but F is equal to the lim sup. So the proof is one line for all X and E, F of X is equal to lim sup of Fn of X, and it's also equal to the lim inf if the Fn's are converging to F. You covered this in 18-100. You have a limit of a sequence if and only if the lim sup equals the lim inf. And this also holds if I include plus or minus infinity as being possible elements of the extended real numbers that are in the sequence or the possible limit. And since this is measurable by the previous theorem, F is measurable. So this is an indicator that we're building something that's stronger than being Riemann integrable. As I've said, the functions which we will define a Lebesgue integral for will be a certain subset of measurable functions. And so taking them as our possible candidates, let me just make the following remark, which now separates measurable functions, which are, again, our candidates for being Lebesgue integrable from Riemann integrable, is that this fails if I replace measurable by Riemann integrable. If Fn, let's go from a, b to even r, is Riemann integrable, and Fn's converge to F point-wise, which just means this for all x in a, b, limit as n goes to infinity of Fn of x equals F of x, then F need not be Riemann integrable. In other words, when I look at Riemann integrable functions, they're not closed undertaking point-wise limits. So yet for the Lebesgue integral, at least for our candidates of Lebesgue measurable functions, those are closed undertaking point-wise limits, as we just proved, which says that we're kind of on track to proving something that has better qualities than the Riemann integral. Now, as it turns out, the point-wise limit of Lebesgue integrable functions need not be Lebesgue integrable, but if you add another very minor condition, the answer is yes, it is Lebesgue integrable. But at the very least, we would like for our candidates, again, Lebesgue measurable functions to be closed undertaking point-wise limits, or at least that should indicate to us that we're doing something that will have better properties than Riemann integrable functions. So why is this? What's a sequence of functions that are Riemann integrable, but their point-wise limit is not Riemann integrable? So for example, you could take the function fn to be, so, you know what, I'm actually going to add this to the assignment then, and it won't be, no, okay, so I'll go ahead and say why this is the case. Let's write, so the rational number is q, and let's say intersect 0, 1, this is a countable set, right, it's a subset of the rational number, so this is a countable set, so we can list them. This is equal to R1, R2, and so on, okay? If I define fn of x to be 1 if x is in R1 up to Rn, and 0 otherwise, now this is a function which is piecewise continuous on 0, 1, so it's Riemann integrable, okay? But what happens is I take n goes to infinity, the point-wise limit of these functions converges to the indicator function of the rational numbers intersect 0, 1, and hopefully this was something that you checked when you learned about Riemann integration if you just learned about, you know, the Riemann integral of continuous functions and that's fine too, but anyways, this function is 1 on the rationals and 0 elsewhere, and which is, you know, a function which is discontinuous everywhere, or, let's see, not everywhere, or yeah, everywhere, and you can convince yourself that that's too crazy of a function to be Riemann integrable if, you know, if all you knew was that continuous functions are Riemann integrable, but if you learned more about the Riemann integral, then one of the things that you learned was that this function is not Riemann integrable, okay? So taking the point-wise limit of Riemann integrable functions may not be Riemann integrable. However, what we've proven is, you know, that the candidates for being Lebesgue integrable, namely those measurable functions, are closed under taking point-wise limits, which is, like I said, an indication that this theory of the integral that we're building up is going to be a stronger theory in the sense that we can prove more things than that of Riemann, and one of those things we'll prove is that the space of Riemann, I mean, Lebesgue integrable functions with a norm being the integral of the absolute value is, in fact, a Banach space as opposed to the Riemann integral. Okay. So now let me just make a couple of final statements and then we'll call it a day for this lecture. So this is just really some terminology that when I make a statement P of X, and I say that with X, you know, an element of a measurable set E, if I say this statement holds almost everywhere on E, I'll usually say, I'll shorten that to just AE, on E or just AE if I'm deleting even more from what I write. This holds almost everywhere if the set where it doesn't hold has measure zero. So, you know, I'm kind of saying, you may think I'm saying two things here that this set is measurable and its measure is zero, but remember, when we developed the theory of measure, first thing we learned about measurable sets is that if it has outer measure equal to zero, then it's measurable. And remember, the measure of a measurable set is just its outer measure. So perhaps I'll say with in parentheses, okay, so a statement holds almost everywhere if the set where it doesn't hold has Lebesgue measure zero, okay, which is equivalent to saying it has outer measure equal to zero because we proved that sets that have outer measure equal to zero are Lebesgue measurable. Okay, and so the final theorem that we'll prove today is that if I have two functions, one measurable, the other differing by that measurable function on a set of measure zero, then the second function is also measurable. So if, so somehow sets of measure zero don't affect being a measurable function. So if F, G go from a measurable set E to the extended real numbers, F is measurable and F equals G almost everywhere on E, meaning the set of Xs where F does not equal G is a set of measure zero in E, then G is measurable. Okay, so if you take a measurable function F, change it on a set of Lebesgue measure zero, you still get a measurable function. Again, this just follows from the fact that all sets of Lebesgue measure zero or outer measure equal to zero are Lebesgue measurable. And then again, the fact that we know measurable sets are closed undertaking unions and complements. So let N be the set of Xs in E such that F of X does not equal G of X. Then this is a set of outer measure zero and therefore it's Lebesgue measurable. Okay, so now if I take an alpha and R and define another set, call it N sub alpha to be the set of all Xs in N such that G of X is greater than alpha. This is a subset of N just by definition. So this is how I'm defining this set. So it has outer measure equal to zero and therefore it's measurable because N has outer measure zero. Okay, then if I take the inverse image of alpha to infinity, this is equal to the inverse image by F of alpha to infinity intersect where they equal each other. So intersect the complement of N union the set N sub alpha. Okay, now N has outer measure zero so it's Lebesgue measurable and therefore its complement is measurable. This is measurable by assumption and therefore this intersection is measurable. And this set here is measurable so the union of this measurable set with this measurable set is again measurable and we conclude that this is measurable. So we have defined measurable real value, extended real value functions and proven some properties of them. The most striking of which being that being measurable is closed under taking pointwise limits and that you can change a function on a set of measure zero and still be measurable. Next time we'll extend this notion in a kind of trivial way to functions which take on complex values not extended, you know, just finite complex numbers not including the pointed at infinity. And then we will move on to defining. So once we have these met so here's the game plan. So we'll extend this notion of being measurable to complex value functions and then we'll show that there's a particular class of functions called simple functions which again are simplest in the sense that they just take on finitely many values and show that those are kind of the universal measurable functions. And from there we will then define the Lebesgue integral of a non-negative measurable function. Okay, and prove some properties of that and then once we've done that so you can define the, you know, an integral of a non-negative, an arbitrary non-negative measurable function we will then restrict to those functions which we call Lebesgue integrable which now can not necessarily non-negative but will have finite Lebesgue integral and then prove some properties of that including the big convergence theorems and then close out our section on or chapter on measure and integration by proving that the Lebesgue integrable functions form a Banach space with a natural norm put on it as opposed to Riemann integrable functions. All right, we'll stop there.
