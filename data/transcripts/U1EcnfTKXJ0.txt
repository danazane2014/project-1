So, basically, the list of topics is simple. It's everything. OK, so, I mean, everything we've seen in class so far is on the exam. But, let me just remind you of the main topics that we've seen. So, first of all, we learned about vectors, how to use them, and dot product. So, at this point, you should probably know that the dot product of two vectors is obtained by summing products of components. And, geometrically, it's the length of A times the length of B times the cosine of the angle between them. And, in particular, we can use dot product to measure angles by solving for cosine theta in this equality. And, most importantly, to detect whether two vectors are perpendicular to each other. Two vectors are perpendicular when their dot product is zero. OK, any questions about that? No? OK, is everyone reasonably happy with dot product by now? Yeah? I see a stunned silence. Nobody happy with dot product so far? OK. OK, so, if you want to look at, you know, in practice 1A, a good example of a typical problem with dot product would be problem 1. And, let's see, we are going to go over the practice exam when I'm done writing this list of topics. I think probably we actually will skip this problem because I think most of you know how to do it. And, if not, then you should run for help from me or from your recitation instructor to figure out how to do it. So, the second topic that we are going to look at is what is a cross-product. So, when you have two vectors in space, you can just form a cross-product by computing this determinant. So, implicitly, we should also know about determinants. By that, I mean two by two and three by three. OK, don't bother reading on larger ones, even if you're interested. They won't be on the test. And, applications of cross-products, so, for example, finding the area of a triangle or a parallelogram in space. So, if you have a triangle in space with sides a and b, then its area is one half of the length of a cross b because the length of a cross b, well, is length a, sine theta, which is the same as the area of a parallelogram formed by these two vectors. And, the other application of cross-product is to find a vector that's perpendicular to two given vectors. So, in particular, to find the vector that's normal to a plane, and then find the equation of the plane. OK, so another application is finding the normal vector to a plane. And, using that, finding the equation of a plane. So, basically, remember, to find the equation of a plane, ax plus by plus cz equals d, what you need is the normal vector to the plane. And, the components of a normal vector are exactly the coefficients that go into this. And, we've seen an argument for why that happens to be the case. So, to find a normal vector to a plane, typically, what we'll do is we'll take two vectors that lie in the plane, and we'll take their cross-product. And, their cross-product will automatically be perpendicular to both of them. OK, so we are going to see an example of that when we look at problem five on practice 1A. I think we'll try to do that one. So, another application, well, let me just mention it as a topic that goes along with this one. So, we've seen also about the plane, and how to find where a line intersects a plane. So, just to refresh your memories, the equation of a line, well, we'll be looking at parametric equations. To know the parametric equation of a line, we need to know a point on the line, and we need to know a vector that's parallel to the line. OK, and if we know a point on the line and a vector along the line, then we can express the parametric equations for the motion of a point that's moving on the line, moving, actually, starting at this point at time zero, and moving with velocity v. So, to put things in symbolic form, you'll get the position of that point by starting with a position at time zero, and adding t times the vector v. So, that gives you x, y, and z in terms of t. And, that's how we represent lines. OK, so we'll look at problem five in a bit, but any general questions about these topics? No, I, oh, do you have a question? Do we have to know Taylor series? That's a good question. No, not on the exam. OK. OK, so Taylor series are something you should be aware of, generally speaking. It will be useful for you in real life, at least if you do, you know, probably not when you go to the supermarket, but if you solve engineering problems, you will need Taylor series. OK, so it would be good not to forget them entirely, but on 18.02 exams, they probably won't be there. OK, let me continue with more topics, and then we can see if you can think of other topics that would not be on the exam. So, third topic would be matrices, linear systems, inverting matrices. So, I know that most of you have calculators that can invert matrices, but still you're expected at this point to know how to do it by hand. If you've looked at the practice tests, both of them have a problem that asks you to invert a matrix, or at least do part of that. And so, it's very likely that tomorrow there will be a problem like that as well. OK, in general, when a kind of problem is on both practice tests, it's a good indication that it might be there also on the actual exam. Unfortunately, not with the same matrix, so you can't learn the answer by heart. OK, so another thing that we've learned about, well, matrices, so I should say this is going to be on the test, and we're on the practice test, on the actual test too, I think, actually. Anyway, so we'll come back to it later. But, so, a couple of things that you should remember. So, if you have a system of the form Ax equals b, then there's two cases. If a determinant of A is not zero, then that means you can compute the inverse matrix, and you can just solve by taking A inverse times b. And, the other case is when the determinant of A is zero, and then there's either no solution, or there's infinitely many. And, so in particular, if you know that there's a solution, for example, if b is zero, there's always an obvious solution, x equals zero, then you will actually have infinitely many. In general, we don't really know how to tell whether it's no solution or infinitely many. OK, questions about that? Yes? Well, we have to know how to rotate vectors, and so on. Not in general, but you might still want to remember how to rotate a vector in the plane by 90 degrees, because that's been useful when we've done problems about parametric equations, which is what I'm coming to next. But, so, what we've seen about rotation matrices, that was a homework part B problem. You're not supposed to remember by heart everything that was in part B of the homework. OK, it's a good idea to have some vague knowledge, because it's useful culture, I would say, useful background for later in your lives. But, no, I won't ask you by heart to know what is the formula for a rotation matrix. OK, and then we come to, last but not least, the problem of finding parametric equations, and in particular, possibly by decomposing the position vector into a sum of simpler vectors. So, you've seen quite an evil example of that on the last problem set with this picture that maybe by now you've had some nightmares about. OK, so anyway, the one on the exam will certainly be easier than that. OK, but as you've seen, the problem, well, whatever. I mean, you should know basically how to analyze a motion that's being described to you, and express it in terms of vectors, and then figure out what the parametric equation will be. Now, again, it won't be as complicated on the exam as the one on the problem set. But, there's a couple of those on the practice exams, and that gives you an idea of what's realistically expected of you. And, now, once we have parametric equations for motion, so that means when we know how to find the position vector as a function of a parameter, maybe of time, then we've seen also about velocity and acceleration, which are the vectors obtained by taking the first and second derivatives of a position vector. And, so, one topic that I will add in there as well is somehow how to prove things about motions by differentiating vector identities. So, one example of that, for example, is when we tried to look at Kepler's law in class last time, we looked at Kepler's second law of planetary motion, and we reduced it to a calculation about the derivative of the cross product, r cross v. So, now, on the exam, you don't need to know the details of Kepler's law, but you need to be able to manipulate vector quantities a bit in the way that we did. And so, on practice exam 1A, you have actually an orgy of problems on this topic because you have problems 2, 4, and 6 all about parametric motions. Probably tomorrow there will not be three distinct problems about parametric motions, but maybe a couple of them. OK, so I think that's basically the list of topics. Anybody spot something that I have forgotten to put on the exam, or questions about something that should or should not be there? OK, you go first. Yeah, yeah. How about parametrizing weird trigonometric functions? I'm not sure what you mean by that. Well, so parametric curves, you need to know how to parametrize motions, and that involves a little bit of trigonometrics. When we've seen these problems about rotating wheels, say the cycloid, for example, and so on, there's a bit of cosine and sine and so on. I think not much more than that. You won't need obscure trigonometric identities. OK, you're next. Any proofs on the exam are just like problems? Well, a problem can ask you to show things. It's not going to be a complicated proof. There's proofs that are going to be fairly easy. If you look at practice 1A, the last problem does have a little bit of proof. 6B says show that blah, blah, blah. But, as you will see, it's not a difficult kind of problem. OK, so about the same. Yes? Are there equations of 3D shapes that we should know at this point? So, well, we should know definitely a lot about equations of planes and lines. And, you should probably know that a sphere centered at the origin is the set of points where distance to the center is equal to the radius of a sphere. We don't need more at this point. OK, as the semester goes on, we'll start seeing cones and things like that. But, at this point, planes, lines, and maybe you need to know about circles and spheres, but nothing beyond that. More questions? Yes? If there's a formula that you have proved on the homework, then, yes, you can assume it on the test. Maybe you want to write on your test that this is a formula you've seen in homework, just so that we know that you remember it from homework and not from looking over your neighbor's shoulder or whatever. But, yes, it's OK to use things that you know, generally speaking. That being said, for example, probably there will be a linear system to solve. It will say on the exam you're supposed to solve that using matrices, not by elimination. OK, so there's things like that. If a problem says solve by using vector methods or things like that, then try to use at least a vector somewhere. But, in general, you're allowed to use things that you know. Yes? Well, we need to go from parametric equations to xy equations. Well, let's say only if it's very easy. OK, if I give you a parametric curve sine t, sine t, then you should be able to observe that it's on the line y equals x. Not beyond that. OK, yes? Do we have to use, sorry? Ah, yes. I don't know if you will have to use it, but certainly you should know a little bit about the unit tension vector. So, just remember, the main thing to know is that the unit tension vector is velocity divided by the speed. I mean, there's not much more to it when you think about it. Yes? Ah, Kepler's law, well, you're allowed to use it if it helps you, if you find a way to squeeze it in. You don't have to know Kepler's law in detail. You just have to know how to reproduce the general steps. So, if I tell you r cross v is constant, you might be expected to know what to do with it. I would say, so basically you don't need to know Kepler's law. You need to know the kind of stuff that we saw when we derived it, such as how to take the derivative of a dot product or a cross product. That's basically the answer. OK, I don't see any questions anymore. So, oh, you're raising your hand. Yes? How to calculate the distance between two lines and the distance between two planes? Well, you've seen probably recently that it's quite painful to do in general. And, no, I don't think that will be on the exam by itself. OK, you need to know how to compute the distance between two points. That, certainly, you need to know. And, also, maybe how to find the component of a vector in a certain direction. And, that's about it, I would say. I mean, the more you know about things, the better. But, things that come up on top of the problem sets are interesting things, but they are usually not needed on the exams. OK, if you have more questions, then you're not raising your hand high enough for me to see it. OK, so let's try to go a bit over this practice exam 1A. Hopefully, everybody has it. If you don't have it, hopefully, your neighbor has it. If you don't have it and your neighbor doesn't have it, please raise your hand. I have a couple of. OK, so, I see more people need it over there. Well, OK, I mean, if your neighbor has it, then just follow on them for now. But, OK, I think there's a few people behind you over there. OK, I'll stop handing them out now. If you really need one, it's on the website. It will be here at the end of class. OK, so let's see. Well, so I think we are going to just skip problems one and two because they are pretty straightforward. And, I hope that you know how to solve them. I mean, I don't know. OK, let's see. How many of you have no problem with problem one? OK, oh, how many of you have trouble with problem one? OK, how many of you haven't raised your hands? OK, how many of you have trouble with problem two? OK, so I think, well, if you have questions about those, maybe you should just come see me at the end because that's probably more efficient that way. So, I'm going to start right away with problem three, actually. OK, so problem three says we have a matrix given to us, 1, 3, 2, 2, 0, minus 1, 1, 1, 0. And, it tells us determinant of A is two, and A inverse equals something, but we are missing two values, A and B, and we are supposed to find them. OK, so that means we need to do the steps of the algorithm to find the inverse of A. So, we are told that A inverse is one half of 1 minus 1 minus 2, 5, 2, 2 minus 6. And here, there's two unknown values. So, remember to invert a matrix, first we compute the minus. Then, we flip some signs to get the cofactors. Then, we transpose. And finally, we divide by the determinant. OK, so let's try to be smart about this. Do we need to compute all nine minors? No, we only need to compute two of them, right? So, which minors do we need to compute? Here and here, or here and here? Yeah, that looks better because, remember, we're going to transpose things. So, these two guys will end up here. OK, so I claim we should compute these two minors. And, we'll see if that's good enough. You know, if you start doing others, and you find that they don't end up in the right place, then just do more. But, you don't need to spend your time computing all nine of them. If you're worried about not doing it right, then, of course, you can maybe compute one or two more to just double check your answers. But, let's just do those that we think are needed. So, the matrix of minors, so, the one that goes in the middle position is obtained by deleting this row and that column. And, we are left with a determinant, three, two, one, zero. Three times zero minus one times two should be minus two. Then, the one for the lower left corner, we delete the last row and the first column. We are left with three, two, zero minus one. Three times minus one is negative three minus zero. We are still left with negative three. OK, is that step clear for everyone? Good. Then, we need to go to cofactors. That means we need to change signs. We change signs in basically these four places. So, that means we'll be left with positive two and negative three. Then, we take the transpose. That means, well, these two, so, the first column will copy into the first row. So, this guy we still don't know. But, here we'll have two, and here we'll have minus three. And, finally, we have to divide by the determinant of A. And, here, well, we are actually told that the determinant of A is two. So, we'll divide by two. But, there's already one half here. So, actually, it's done for us. OK, so, the values that we'll get are going to be two and negative three. OK, now, let's see how we use that to solve a linear system. So, if we have to solve a linear system, so, then, well, the matrix is invertible. Its determinant is not zero. So, we can certainly write x equals A inverse B. So, we have to multiply, oh, there's that one half, one, two, negative three, minus one, minus two, five, two, two, negative three times B is one, negative two, one. Well, so, remember to do a matrix multiplication, you take the rows in here, the columns in here, and you do dot products. OK, so, the first entry will be one times one plus two times minus two plus minus three times one. That's one minus four minus three should be negative six. Except, I still have, of course, a one half in front. Then, minus one plus four plus five should be eight. Two minus four minus six should be negative eight. So, that will simplify to minus three, four, minus four. OK, any questions about that? OK, so now we come to part C, which is the harder part of this problem. So, it says, let's take this matrix, A, and let's replace the two in the upper right corner by some other number, C. So, that means we'll look at this as two, zero, minus one, one, one, zero. And, well, let's call that M. And, first, it asks you to find a value of C for which this matrix is not invertible. OK, so, M is not invertible exactly when the determinant of M is zero. So, let's compute the determinant. Well, we should do one times that smaller determinant, which is one times one, minus three times that determinant, which is zero plus one is one. And then, we have plus C times the lower left determinant, which is two times one minus zero is two. OK, so that gives us one minus two plus two C, sorry, one minus three is negative two, plus two C. That's zero when C equals one. OK, so for C equals one, this matrix is not invertible. For other values, it is invertible. OK, so it goes on to say, well, let's look at this value of C, and let's look at the system Mx equals zero. So, I'm going to put that value one in there. OK, so, now if we look at Mx equals zero, well, this has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. But, here, there's an obvious solution, namely, x equals zero is a solution. OK, maybe let me rewrite it geometrically. That's x plus three y plus z equals zero, 2x minus z equals zero, and x plus y equals zero. OK, so you see we have an obvious solution, zero, zero, zero. But, we have more solutions. How do we find more solutions? Well, x, y, z is a solution if it's in all three of these planes. That's a way to think about it. So, probably we're actually in this situation where, in fact, we have three planes that are all passing for the origin, and all parallel to the origin line. And so, that would be the line of solutions. So, to find it, actually, we can think of this as follows. So, the first observation is that, actually, in this situation, we don't need all three equations. OK, the fact that the system has infinitely many solutions means that, actually, one of the equations is redundant. So, if you look at it for long enough, you see, for example, if you multiply three times this equation, and you subtract that one, then you will get the first equation, right? Three times x plus y minus 2x minus z will be x plus 3y plus z. Now, we don't actually need to see that to solve the problem. I'm just showing you that's what happens when you have a matrix with determinant zero. One of the equations, somehow, is a duplicate of the others. We don't actually need to figure out how exactly. But, so, what that means is, really, we want to solve, let's say, start with two of the equations. So, to find a solution, we can observe that the first equation says, actually, that x, y, z dot product with 1, 3, 1 equals zero. And, the second equation says x, y, z dot product with 2, 0, negative 1 is zero. And, the third equation, if we really want to keep it, we should be also having this. Now, these equations, now, written like this, they are just saying we want an x, y, z that's perpendicular to these vectors. So, let's forget this one, and let's just look at these two. They are saying we want a vector that's perpendicular to these two given vectors. How do we find that? We do the cross product, right? So, to find x, y, z perpendicular to 1, 3, 1 and 2, 0, negative 1, we take the cross product. And, that will give us something. Well, let me just give you the answer. I'm sure you know how to do cross products by now. I don't have the answer here, so I guess I have to do it. OK, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, negative 1. That should be negative 3, minus 1, minus 2, probably positive 3, and then negative 6. OK, so that's a solution. And, any multiple of that is a solution. So, if you like neatly simplified answers, you could say negative 1, 1, negative 2. If you like larger numbers, you could multiply that by a million. That's also a solution. OK, any questions about that? Yes? That's correct. If you pick these two guys instead, you will get the same solution, well, up to a multiple. It could be that if you do the cross product of these two guys, you actually get something that's a multiple. Actually, I think if you do the cross product of the first and third one, you will get, actually, minus 1, minus 2, the smaller one. But, it doesn't matter. I mean, it's really in the same direction. This is all because a plane has, actually, normal vectors of all sizes. Yes? I don't think so. OK, so an important thing to remember about cross product is we compute the minors, but then we put a minus sign on the second component. OK, so the coefficient of J in here, the second component, is minus 1 minus 2 times 1. That's negative 3, indeed, but then you actually change that to a positive 3. Yes? Sorry? Do we have to? Well, we don't have parametric equations here. Oh, so solving by elimination. Well, if it says that you have to use vector methods, then you should use vector methods. OK, if it says you should use vectors and matrices, then you're expected to do it that way. Yes? So, it depends what the problem is asking. OK, the question is, is it enough to find the components of a vector, or do we have to find the equation of a line? Here it says find one solution using vector operations. So, we have found one solution. If you wanted to find the line, then it would be all the things that are proportional to this. So, it would be maybe minus 3t, 3t minus 6t, right, all the multiples of that vector. We do because 0, 0, 0 is an obvious solution here. OK, yes, so maybe I should, OK, I'll write that on the board. You had another question? Not quite. OK, so let me re-explain first how we get all the solutions, and why I did that cross multiplication. I see that's a topic. OK, so first of all, why did I take that cross product again? So, I took that cross product because I looked at my free equations, and I observed that my free equations can be reformulated in terms of these dot products, OK, saying that x, y, z is actually perpendicular to these guys, and these guys are the normal vectors to the planes. Remember, to be in all three planes, it needs to be perpendicular to the normal vectors. So, that's how we got here. And now, if we want something that's perpendicular to a bunch of given vectors, well, to be perpendicular to two vectors, an easy way to find one is to take that cross product. And, if you take any two of them, you will get something that's the same up to scaling. So now, what it means here is that, well, we have our three planes, and they're all parallel. They all actually contain the same line. And, we know that's actually really the case because they all pass through the origin. OK, they pass through the origin because the constant terms are just zero. So, what happens is that the normal vectors to these planes are, in fact, all perpendicular to that line. OK, the normal vectors are actually all, say this line is vertical, the normal vectors are all going to be horizontal. Well, it's kind of hard to draw. And so, by taking the cross product between two of the normal vectors, we found this direction. So now, to find actually all the solutions, so what we know so far is that we have this direction, minus three, three, minus six, that is going to be parallel to the line of intersections. Let me draw it here, for example, minus three, three, minus six. And so now, we have one particular solution, zero, zero, zero. Actually, we have found another one, too, which is minus three, three, minus six. But anyway, so now the line of solutions has parametric equation x equals minus 3t, y equals 3t, z equals negative 6t, or anything proportional to that. OK, so that's how we would find all the solutions if we wanted them. OK, all right. It's almost time, so I think I need to jump ahead to other problems. So, let's see. Problem four, I think problem four you can probably find for yourselves. It's a reasonably straightforward parametric equations problem. You just have to find the coordinates of that point P, and for that it's a very simple trick. Problem five, find the area of a space triangle. Sounds like a cross product. Find the equation of a plane. Also sounds like a cross product. OK, and find the intersection of this plane with a line means we find first the parametric equation of a line, and then we plug that into the equation of a plane to get where they intersect. OK, does that sound reasonable? OK, who's desperate about problem five? OK, let me repeat problem five. So, first part, we have to find the area of a triangle. And, the way to do that is to just do one half of the length of a cross product between, if we have three points, P0, P1, P2, then maybe we can form vectors P0, P1, and P0, P2. And, if we take that cross product, and take the length of that, and divide by two, that will give us the area of a triangle. OK, so here, turns out that this guy is 1, 1, 2 if I look at the solutions. So, you will end up with square root of six over two. The second one is, I think, useful, the equation of a plane. Well, containing these three points, well, first of all, we know that the normal vector to the plane is going to be given by this cross product again. OK, so that means that the equation of a plane will be of the form x y 2z equals something. OK, just the coefficients here come from the normal vector. And, to find what goes on the right-hand side, we just plug in any of the points. So, if we plug in P0, which is, so, P0 is 2, 1, 0. Then, 2 plus 1 seems like it's three. And, if you want to double check your answer, you can take P1 and P2, and check that you also get three. It's a good way to check your answer. OK, and then the third part, so we have a line parallel to the vector v equals 1, 1, 1 through the point S, which is minus 1, 0, 0. That means you can find its intersection. OK, so x will be, starts at minus 1, increases at rate one. y starts at zero, increases at rate one. z starts at zero, increases at rate one. You plug these into the plane equation, and that will tell you where they intersect. Is that clear? OK, OK, and now, in the last one minute, oh, on that side, I have one minute. Let me just say very quickly, uh-oh, well, do you want to hear about problem six anyway very quickly? Yeah, OK. So, problem six, it's one of these vector calculations. So, it says we have a position vector, r, and it asks you, how do we find the derivative of r dot r? Well, remember we have the product rule for taking the derivative, OK? uv prime is u prime v plus uv prime also applies for dot product. So, that's dr dt dot r plus r dot dr dt. And, these are both the same thing. So, you get two r dot dr dt, but dr dt is v. That's the velocity vector. OK, hopefully you've seen things like that. Now, it says show that if r has constant length, then r and v are perpendicular. So, all you need to write, basically, is we assume length r is constant. That's what it says, r has constant length. Well, how do we get to say something? We probably want to reduce to that. Well, if r is constant in length, then r dot r is also constant. And so, that means d by dt of r dot r is zero. That's what it means to be constant. And so, that means r dot v is perpendicular to v. That's a proof. It's not a scary proof. And then, the last question of the exam says let's continue to assume that r has constant length, and let's try to find r dot a. So, if there's acceleration, then probably we should bring it in somewhere, maybe by taking a derivative of something. OK, so if we know that r dot v equals zero, let's take the derivative of that. That's still zero. But now, using the product rule, well, dr dt is v dot v plus r dot dv dt is going to be zero. So, that means that you're asked about r dot a. Well, that's equal to minus v dot v. And, that's it.
