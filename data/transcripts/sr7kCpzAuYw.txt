OK, so, remember, we've seen Stokes' theorem, which says if I have a closed curve in space bounding some surface S, and I orient the curve and the surface compatibly with each other, then I can compute a line integral along C, along my curve, in terms of, instead, a surface integral for flux of a different vector field, namely curl F dot n dS. OK, so that's the statement. And, just to clarify a little bit, so, again, we've seen various kinds of integrals. So, line integrals, we know how to evaluate that take place in a curve. You express everything in terms of one variable. And, after substituting, you end up with a usual one variable integral that you know how to evaluate. And, surface integrals, we know also how to evaluate. Namely, we've seen various formulas for n dS. Once you have such a formula, you do the dot product with this vector field, which is not the same as that one, but it's a new vector field that you can build out of F. You do the dot product. You express everything in terms of your two integration variables, and then you evaluate. So, now, what does this have to do with various other things? Well, one thing I want to say has to do with how Stokes helps us understand path independence, so how it actually motivates our criterion for gradient fields, independence. OK, so we've seen, we've said that if we have a vector field defined in a simply connected region, and its curl is zero, then it's a gradient field, and the line integral is path independent. So, let me first define for you what a simply connected region is. So, we say that the region in which a path is defined is a closed region if every closed loop inside this region bounds some surface, again, is a closed region. OK, so let me just give you some examples just to clarify. So, for example, let's say that I have a region that's the entire space with the origin removed. OK, so space with the origin removed, OK, do you think it's simply connected? Who thinks it's simply connected? Who thinks it's not simply connected? Let's think a little bit harder. Let's say that I take a loop like this one, OK, it doesn't go through the origin. Can I find a surface that's bounded by this loop and that does not pass through the origin? Yeah, I can take the sphere, for example, or anything that's just not quite the disk. So, and similarly, if I take any other loop that avoids the origin, I can find, actually, a surface bounded by it that does not pass through the origin. So, actually, that's a kind of not so obvious theorem to prove, but maybe intuitively start by finding any surface. Well, if that surface passes through the origin, just wiggle it a little bit, you can make sure it doesn't pass through the origin anymore. You know, just push it a little bit. So, in fact, this is simply connected. That was a trick question. OK, now, on the other hand, a good example of something that is not simply connected is if I take space and I remove the z axis. That is not simply connected. And, see, the reason is, if I look again, I have a unit circle in the x axis, sorry, a unit circle in the xy plane. So, if I try to find a surface whose boundary is this disk, well, it has to actually cross the z axis somewhere. There's no way that I can find a surface whose only boundary is this curve, which doesn't hit the z axis anywhere. Of course, you could try to use the same trick as there, say, maybe we want to go up, up, up. Let's start with a cylinder. Well, the problem is you would have to go infinitely far because the z axis goes infinitely far, and you'll never be able to actually close your surface. So, no matter what kind of trick you might want to use, it's actually a theorem in topology that you cannot find a surface bounded by this disk without intersecting the z axis. Yes? Well, a donut shape certainly would stay away from the z axis, but it wouldn't be a surface with boundary just this guy. It would have to have either some other boundary. So, maybe what you have in mind is some sort of donut shape like this that goes on itself and maybe comes back. Well, if you don't quite close it all the way around, so I can try to indeed draw some sort of donut here, well, if I don't quite close it, then it will have another edge at the other end where I started. If I close it completely, then this curve is no longer its boundary because my surface lives on both sides of this curve. See, I want a surface that stops on this curve and doesn't go beyond it. And, nowhere else does it have that kind of behavior. Everywhere else it keeps going on its own. So, actually, maybe another way to convince yourself is to find a counterexample to the statement I'm going to make about vector fields with curl zero in simply connected regions always being conservative. So, what you can do is you can take the example that we had in one of our older problem sets. That was a vector field in the plane. But, you can also use it to define a vector field in space just with no z component. That vector field is actually defined everywhere except on the z axis, and it violates the usual theorem that we would expect. So, that's one way to check just for sure that this thing is not simply connected. So, what's the statement I want to make? So, recall we've seen if F is a gradient field, then its curl is zero. That's just the fact that the mixed second partial derivatives are equal. So now, the converse is the same. It says if the curl of F equals zero, and F is defined, it's not the logical way in which to say it, but if F is defined in a simply connected region and curl F is zero, then F is a gradient field, and the line integral for F is path independent, F is conservative, and so on, all the usual consequences. Remember, these are all equivalent to each other, for example, because you can use path independence to define the potential by doing the line integral of F. OK, so where do we use the assumption of being defined in a simply connected region? Well, the way in which we will prove this is to use Stokes' theorem. So, the proof, so I'm just going to prove that the line integral is path independent. The others work the same way. OK, so let's assume that we have a vector field whose curl is zero. And, let's say that we have two curves, C1 and C2, that go from some point P0 to some point P1, the same point to the same point. Well, we'd like to understand the line integral along C1, say, minus the line integral along C2 to show that this is zero. OK, that's what we are trying to prove. So, how will we compute that? Well, the line integral along C1 minus C2, well, let's just form a closed curve that is C1 minus C2. OK, so let's call C, oops, so that's equal to the integral along C of F dot dr where C is C1 followed by C2 backwards. Now, C is a closed curve. So, I can use Stokes' theorem. Well, to be able to use Stokes' theorem, I need actually to find a surface to apply it to. And, that's where the assumption of simply connected is useful. I know in advance that any closed curve, so C in particular, has to bound some surface. OK, so we can find S, a surface S that bounds C because the region is simply connected. So, now that tells us we can actually apply Stokes' theorem, except it won't fit here. So, instead I will do that on the other side. That's equal by Stokes to the double integral over S of curl F dot vector dS, or n dS. But now, the curl is zero. So, if I integrate zero, I will get zero. OK, so I've proved that my two line integrals along C1 and C2 are equal. But, for that, I needed to be able to find a surface to which to apply Stokes' theorem. And, that required my region to be simply connected. If I had a vector field that was defined only outside of a z axis, and I took two paths that went on one side and the other side of a z axis, I might have obtained actually different values of a line integral. OK, so anyway, that's the customary warning about simply connected things. OK, let me just mention very quickly that there's a lot of interesting topology you can do, actually, in space. So, for example, this concept of being simply connected or not, and studying which loops bound surfaces or not, can be used to classify shapes of things inside space. So, for example, one of the founding achievements of topology in the 19th century was to classify surfaces in space by trying to look at loops on them. So, what I mean by that is if I take the surface of a sphere, well, I claim the surface of a sphere is simply connected. Why is that? Well, let's take my favorite closed curve on the surface of the sphere. I can always find a portion of the sphere that's bounded by it. OK, so that's the definition of the surface of a sphere being simply connected. On the other hand, if I take what's called a torus, or if you prefer the surface of a donut, that's more, it's a less technical term, then that's not simply connected. And, in fact, for example, if you look at this loop here that goes around it, well, of course it bounds a surface in space. But, that surface cannot be made to be just a piece of a donut. You have to go through the hole. You have to leave the surface of a torus. In fact, there's another one. See, this one also does not bound anything that's completely contained in the torus. And, of course, it bounds this disk that's inside of a torus, but that's not a part of the surface itself. So, in fact, there's, topologists would say there's two independent loops that don't bound surfaces, that don't bound anything. And, so this number two is somehow an invariant that you can associate to this kind of shape. And then, if you consider more complicated surfaces with more holes in them, you can try somehow to count the independent loops on them. And, that's the beginning of the classification of surfaces. Anyway, that's not really an 18.02 topic, but I thought I would mention it because it's kind of a cool idea. OK, let me say a bit more in the way of fun remarks like this. So, food for thought. Let's say that I want to apply Stokes' theorem to simplify a line integral along this curve here. OK, so this curve, it's maybe not easy to see on the picture, it kind of goes twice around the z axis, but spirals up and then down. OK, so one way to find a surface that's bounded by this curve is to take what's called the Mobius strip. OK, so the Mobius strip, it's a one-sided strip where, when you go around, you flip one side becomes the other. So, you just, if you want, take a band of paper and glue the two sides with a twist. So, it's a one-sided surface. And, that gives us actually serious trouble if we try to orient it to apply Stokes' theorem. So, see, for example, if I take this Mobius strip, and I try to find an orientation, so here it looks like that. Well, let's say that I've oriented my curve going in this direction. So, I go around, around, around, still going in this direction. Well, the orientation I should have is that when I, so, curve continues here in case, well, if you look at the convention around here, it tells us that the normal vector should be going this way. OK, if we look at it near here, if we walk along this way, the surface is to our right, so we should actually be flipping things upside down. The normal vector should be going down. And, in fact, if you try to follow your normal vector that's pointing down, it's pointing up, up, up, it will have to go a bit into things, into, into, down. There's no way to choose consistently a normal vector for the Mobius strip. So, that's what we call a non-orientable surface. And, that just means it has only one side. And, if it has only one side, we cannot speak of flux for it because we have no way of saying that we'll be counting things positively one way, negatively the other way because there's only one, you know, there's no notion of sides. So, you can't define a side towards which things will be going positively. So, that's actually a situation where flux cannot be defined. OK, so as much as Mobius strips and Klein bottles are exciting and really cool, well, we can't use them in this class because we can't define flux for them. So, if we really wanted to apply Stokes' theorem, because I've been telling you that space is simply connected, and I will always be able to apply Stokes' theorem to any curve, what would I do? Well, I claim this curve actually bounds another surface that is orientable. Yeah, that looks counterintuitive. Well, let's see it. I claim you can take a hemisphere, and you can take a small thing and twist it around. So, in case you don't believe me, let me do it again with the transparency. Here's my loop. And, see, well, the scale is not exactly the same, so it doesn't quite match. But, and it's getting a bit dark, but that spherical thing with a little slit going, twisting into it, will actually have boundary, my loop. And, that one is orientable. I mean, I leave it up to you to stare at the picture long enough to convince yourselves that it's actually defined up and down. OK, so now, I mean, in case you're getting really, really worried, I mean, there won't be any Mobius strips on the exam on Tuesday, OK? It's just to show you some cool stuff. OK, questions? No? OK, one last thing I want to show you before we start reviewing. So, one question you might have about Stokes' theorem is how come we can choose whatever surface we want? I mean, sure, it seems to work, but it doesn't. So, I'm going to say a couple of words about surface independence in Stokes' theorem. So, let's say that I have a curve C in space. And, let's say that I want to apply Stokes' theorem. So, then I can choose my favorite surface bounded by C. So, in a situation like this, for example, I might want to make my first choice be this guy, S1, like maybe some sort of upper half sphere. And, if you pay attention to the orientation conventions, you'll see that you need to take it with normal vector pointing up. Maybe, actually, I would rather make a different choice. Actually, I will choose another surface, S2, that maybe looks like that. And, if I look carefully at the orientation convention, Stokes' theorem tells me that I have to take the normal vector pointing up again, so that's actually in two things. So, Stokes says that the line integral along C of my favorite vector field can be computed either as a flux integral for the curve through S1, or as the same integral but through S2 instead of S1. So, that seems to suggest that curve F has some sort of surface independence property. It doesn't really matter which surface I take as long as the surface is given curve C. Why is that? That's a strange property to have. Where does it come from? Well, let's think about it for a second. So, why are these the same? I mean, of course, they have to be the same because that's what Stokes tells us. But, why is that OK? Well, let's think about comparing the flux integral through S1 and the flux integral through S2. So, if we want to compare them, we should probably subtract them from each other. OK, so let's do the flux integral for S1 minus the flux integral for S2 of the same thing. Well, let's give a name. Let's call S the surface S1 minus S2. So, what is S? S is S1 with its given orientation together with S2 with a reversed orientation. So, S is actually this whole closed surface here. And, the normal vector to S seems to be pointing outwards everywhere. OK, so now if we have a closed surface with a normal vector pointing outwards, and we want to find a flux integral through it, well, we can replace that with a triple integral. So, that's the divergence theorem. So, that's by the divergence theorem using the fact that S is a closed surface. That's equal to the triple integral of the region inside, let me call that region D, of divergence of curl F, dV. OK, and what I'm going to claim now is that we can actually check that if you take the divergence of the curl of a vector field, you always get zero. OK, and so that will tell you that this integral will always be zero. And, that's why the flux for S1 and the flux for S2 were the same a priori. And, we didn't have to worry about which one we chose when we did Stokes' theorem. OK, so let's just check quickly that divergence of a curl is zero. In case you're wondering why I'm doing all this, well, first, I think it's kind of interesting. And, second, it reminds you of the statement of all these theorems and all these definitions. So, in a way, we're already reviewing. OK, so let's see. If my vector field has two components, P, Q, and R, remember that the curl was defined by this cross product between del and our given vector field. So, that's Ry minus Qz followed by Pz minus Rx and Qx minus Py. So, now we want to take the divergence of this. Well, so we have to take the first component, Ry minus Qz, and take its partial with respect to x. Then, take the y component, Pz minus Rx partial with respect to y plus Qx minus Py partial with respect to z. And, well, now we should expand this, but I claim it will always simplify to zero. OK, so I think we have over there becomes R sub yx minus Q sub zx plus P sub zy minus R sub xy plus Q sub xz minus P sub yz. Well, let's see. We have P sub zy minus P sub yz. These two cancel out. We have R sub yx minus R sub xy. These cancel out. Q sub zx and Q sub xz, these two also cancel out. So, indeed, the divergence of a curl is always zero. OK, so the claim is divergence of curl is always zero. Del dot del cross F is always zero. And, just a small remark, if we had actually real vectors, you know, rather than this strange del guy, indeed, we know that if we have two vectors, u and v, and we do u dot u cross v, what is that? Well, one way to say it is it's the determinant of u, u and v, which is the volume of a box, but it's completely flat because u, u and v are all in the plane defined by u and v. The other way to say it is that u cross v is perpendicular to u and v. Well, if it's perpendicular to u, then its dot product with u will be zero. So, no matter how you say it, it's always zero. So, in a way, this reinforces our intuition that del, even though it's not at all an actual vector, sometimes it can be manipulated in the same way. OK, I think that's it for new ideas. And, so now I should maybe try to recap quickly what we've learned in these past three weeks so that you know. So, the exam is probably going to be similar in difficulty to the practice exams. That's my goal. I don't know if I will have reached that goal or not. We'll only know that after the test. But, the idea is it's meant to be more or less the same level of difficulty. So, at this point, we've learned about three kinds of beasts in space. OK, so I'm going to divide my blackboard into three pieces. And here, I will write triple integrals. We've learned about double integrals, and we've learned about line integrals. OK, so triple integrals of a region in space, we integrate a scalar quantity dV. How do we do that? Well, we can do that in rectangular coordinates where dV becomes maybe something like dz dx dy or any permutation of these. We've seen how to do it also in cylindrical coordinates where dV is maybe dz times r dr d theta, or more commonly, r dr d theta dz. But, what I want to emphasize in this way is that both of these you set up pretty much in the same way. Remember, the main trick here is to find the bounds of integration. So, when you do it, say, with dz first, that means for fixed x, y, so for a fixed point in the x, y plane, you have to look at the bounds for z. So, that means you have to figure out what's the bottom surface of your solid, and what's the top surface of your solid. And, you have to find the value of z at the bottom, the value of z at the top as functions of x and y. And then, you will put that as z. Once you've done that, you're left with a question of finding bounds for x and y. Well, for that, you just rotate the picture, look at your solid from above, so look at its projection to the x, y plane, and you set up a double integral either in rectangular x, y coordinates or in polar coordinates for x and y. Of course, you can also do it in other orders, and I'll let you figure out again how that goes. But, if you do dz first, then the inner bounds are given by bottom and top, and the outer ones are given by looking at the shadow of the region. Now, there's also spherical coordinates. And there, we've seen that dv is rho squared sine phi d rho d phi d theta. So now, of course, if this orgy of Greek letters is confusing you at this point, then you probably need to first review spherical coordinates for themselves. Remember that rho is the distance from the origin. Phi is the angle down from the z axis. So, it's zero on the positive z axis, pi over two in the x, y plane, and increases all the way to pi on the negative z axis. And, theta is the angle around the origin. So now, when we set up bounds here, it will look a lot like what you've done in polar coordinates in the plane because when you look at the inner bounds, the bound on rho, for a fixed phi and theta, that means you're shooting a straight ray from the origin in some direction in space. So, you're sending maybe a laser beam, and you want to know what part of your beam is going to be in your given solid. You want to solve for the value of rho when you enter the solid and when you leave it. I mean, very often, if the origin is in your solid, then rho will start at zero. And, you want to know when you exit. And, I mean, there's a fairly small list of kinds of surfaces that we've seen how to set up in spherical coordinates. So, if you're really obsessed by this, go over the problems in the notes. That will give you a good idea of what kinds of things we've seen in spherical coordinates. OK, and then, evaluation is the usual way. Questions about this? No. OK, so I should say, I'm going to do something bad, but, so we've seen, of course, applications of this. So, we should know how to use a triple integral to evaluate things like a mass of a solid, the average value of a function, the moment of inertia about one of the coordinate axes, or the gravitational attraction on a mass at the origin. OK, so these are just formulas to remember for examples of triple integrals. It doesn't change conceptually. You always set them up and evaluate them the same way. It just tells you what to put in there for the integrant. Now, double integrals. So, when we have a surface in space, well, what we will integrate on it, at least what we've seen how to integrate, is a vector field dotted with the unit normal vector times the area element. OK, and this is sometimes called vector dS. Now, how do we evaluate that? Well, we've seen formulas for N dS in various settings. And, once you have a formula for N dS, that will relate N dS to maybe dx dy or something else. And then, you will express, so, for example, N dS equals something dx dy. And then, it becomes a double integral of something dx dy. Now, in the integrant, you want to express everything in terms of x and y. So, if you had a z, maybe you have a formula for z in terms of x and y. And, when you set up the bounds, well, you try to figure out what are the bounds for x and y that would be just looking at it from above. Of course, if you're using other variables, figure out the bounds for those variables. And, when you've done that, it becomes just a double integral in the usual sense. OK, so maybe I should be a bit more explicit about formulas because there have been a lot. So, let me tell you about a few of them. Let me actually do that over here because I don't want to make this too crowded. OK, so what kinds of formulas for N dS have we seen? Well, we've seen a formula, for example, for a horizontal plane or for something that's parallel to the yz plane or the xz plane. Well, let's do just the yz plane for a quick reminder. So, if I have a surface that's contained inside the yz plane, then, obviously, I will express dS in terms of, well, I will use y and z as my variables. So, I will say that dS is dy dz, or dz dy, whatever is most convenient. Maybe we'll even switch to polar coordinates after that if the problem wants us to. And, what about the normal vector? Well, the normal vector is either coming straight at us, or it's maybe going back away from us depending on which orientation we've chosen. So, this gives us N dS. We dot our favorite vector field with it. We integrate, and we get the answer. We've seen about spheres and cylinders centered at the origin, or centered on the z axis. So, the normal vector sticks straight out or straight in depending on which direction you do it in. So, for a sphere, the normal vector is x, y, z divided by the radius of the sphere. For a cylinder, it's x, y, 0 divided by the radius of the sphere. And, the surface element on a sphere, so, see, it's very closely related to the volume element of spherical coordinates, except you don't have a rho anymore. You just plug in rho equals a. So, you get a squared sine phi d phi d theta. And, for a cylinder, it would be a dz d theta. So, by the way, I mean, just a quick sanity check. When you're doing an integral, if it's a surface integral, there should be two integral signs, and there should be two integration variables, and there should be two d somethings. If you have a wrong number of, if you end up with a dx, dy, dz in the surface integral, something is seriously wrong. OK, now, besides these specific formulas, we've seen two general formulas that are also useful. So, one is, if we know how to express z in terms of x and y, and just to change the notation to show you that it's not set in stone, let's say that z is known as a function of d of x and y. So, how do I get n dS in that case? Well, we've seen a formula that says negative partial z partial x, negative partial z partial y, one dx dy. So, this formula relates the surface element on our surface to the area element in the x, y plane. It lets us convert between dS and dx dy. OK, so we just plug in this, and we dot with f, and then we substitute everything in terms of x and y, and we evaluate the integral over x and y. If we don't really want to find a way to find z as a function of x and y, but we have a normal vector given to us, then we have another formula which says that n dS is, sorry, I should have said it's always up to sign because we have the two orientation conventions. We have to decide, based on what we are trying to do, whether we are doing the correct convention of the wrong convention. So, the other formula is n over n dot k dx dy. Sorry, are they all the same? There's no, well, if you want, you can put an absolute value here. But, it doesn't matter because it's up to sign anyway. So, I mean, this formula is valid as it is. OK, and they will all eventually, I mean, if you're in a situation where you can apply more than one formula, they will all give you the same answer in the end because it's the same flux integral. OK, so anyway, so we have various ways of computing surface integrals. And, probably one of the best possible things you can do to prepare for the test is actually to look again at some practice problems from the notes that do flux integrals over various kinds of surfaces because that's probably one of the hardest topics in this unit of the class. OK, anyway, let's move on to line integrals. So, now, those are actually a piece of cake in comparison, because all that this is is just integral of Pdx Qdy Rdz. And, then all you have to do is parametrize the curve C to everything in terms of a single variable. And, then you end up with a usual single integral, and you can just compute it. So, that one works pretty much as it did in the plane. So, if you haven't forgotten what we did in the plane, it's really the same thing. OK, so now we have three different kinds of integrals. And, really, well, they certainly have in common that they integrate things somehow. But, apart from that, they are extremely different in what they do. I mean, this one involves a function, a scalar quantity. These involve vector quantities. They don't involve the same kinds of shapes over which to integrate. Here, you integrate over a three-dimensional region. Here, you integrate only over a two-dimensional surface. And, here, only a one-dimensional curve. So, try not to confuse them. That's basically the most important advice. Don't get mistaken. Each of them has a different way of getting evaluated. Eventually, they will all give you numbers, but through different processes. So, now, well, I said these guys are completely different. Well, but we still have some bridges between them. OK, so we have two, maybe I should say three, well, two bridges between these guys. OK, so we have somehow a connection between these, which is the divergence theorem. And, we have a connection between that, which is Stokes' theorem. So, just to write them again, so the divergence theorem says if I have a region in space, and I call its boundary S, so it's going to be a closed surface, and I orient S with a normal vector pointing outwards, then whenever I have a surface integral over S, I can replace it by a triple integral of the region inside. OK, so this guy is a vector field, and this guy is a function that somehow relates to the vector field. I mean, you should even know how. You should know the definition of divergence, of course. But, what I want to point out is if you have to compute the two sides separately, well, this is just your standard flux integral. This is just your standard triple integral of the region in space. Once you have computed what this guy is, it's really just the triple integral of a function. So, the way in which you compute it doesn't see that it came from a divergence. It's just the same way that you would compute any other triple integral. The way we compute it doesn't depend on what actually we are integrating. Stokes' theorem says if I have a curve that's the boundary of the surface S, and I orient the two in that direction, then I can replace a line integral on C by a surface integral on S. OK, and that surface integral, well, it's not for the same vector field. This relates a line integral for one field to a surface integral from another field. And, the vector field is given from the first one just by taking its curve. So, after you take the curve, you obtain a different vector field. And, the way in which you will compute this surface integral is just as with any surface integral. You just find a formula for N dS dot product, substitute, evaluate. The calculation of this thing, once you've computed curve, does not remember that it was a curve. It's the same as with any other surface integral. OK, and finally, the last bridge, so this was like between two and three. This was between one and two. Let me just say there's a bridge between zero and one, which is that if you have a function and its gradient, well, the fundamental theorem of calculus says that the line integral for the vector field given by the gradient of a function is actually equal to the change in value of a function. That's if you have a curve bounded by P zero and P one. So, in a way, actually, each of these three theorems relates a quantity with a certain number of integral signs to a quantity with one more integral sign. And, that's actually somehow a fundamental similarity between them. But, maybe it's easier to think of them as completely different stories. So, now, with this one, we additionally have to remember another topic is given a vector field F with curl equal to zero, find the potential. And, we've seen two methods for that, and I'm sure you remember them. So, if not, then try to remember them for Tuesday. OK, so, anyway, again, conceptually, we have really three different kinds of integrals. We evaluate them in completely different ways. And, just we have a handful of theorems connecting them to each other. But, that doesn't have any impact on how we actually compute things.
