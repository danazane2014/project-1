Given a user comment on YouTube from a math MIT OCW video, your task is to label whether the comment mentions the userâ€™s personal experience learning or teaching math on their own outside of watching this lecture/series. If it is true, then label "true"; otherwise, label "false".

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Comment: Amazing! I like linear algebra a lot, I already had this class in college, I keep reading about it and ... I didn't even notice the passing of 40 minutes of the first class you! No wonder MIT is a world reference!
Task: Does the comment mention the user's personal experience learning or teaching math on their own outside of watching this lecture/series?
Label: true

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: 6.041 Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability
Video name: 14. Poisson Process I
Comment: I am having a hard time making sense of the notation at 11:22.  I believe the notation should be the conditional probability P(k|t) rather than P(k,t). I interpreted the latter to be the joint probability and if it is the case, the summation over all k of P(k,t) given a fixed t could not be equal to 1. Anyone, please help knock some sense to my head!

Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Comment: Wish this guy taught me Math 293 and 294 at Cornell. My guy could barely speak English, let alone explain what we were trying to accomplish. I understood that if we wanted eigenvectors perpendicular to x we'd get lift relative to flow...but this guy would have made the math a bit simpler.
