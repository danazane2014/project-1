Given a user comment on YouTube from a math MIT OCW video, your task is to label whether the comment explicitly mentions a pedagogical method, which includes but is not limited to the use of examples, applications, worked out problems, proofs, visualizations, elaboration, step-by-step explanation, reiteration, and analogies. If this is true, then label "true"; otherwise, label "false".

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Comment: He's just showing applications of linear algebra, not teaching them. That's why it seems "sloppy". You just can't teach Fourier Transform in 30 mins.
Task: Does the comment explicitly mention a pedagogical method?
Label: true

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Comment: This lecture plus 3blue1brown's videos are getting these concepts to stick for me. Thank you Prof. Strang!!!
Task: Does the comment explicitly mention a pedagogical method?
Label: false

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Comment: His teaching style seems casual and intuitive. I go to a small public college and the course is much more formal and proof driven. These lectures are a great addition to (as well as a nice break from)  formal proofs. Thanks MIT!
