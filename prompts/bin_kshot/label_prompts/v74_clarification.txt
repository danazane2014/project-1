Given a user comment on YouTube from a math MIT OCW video, your task is to label whether the comment clarifies someone's *math-related* misunderstanding or elaborates content from the video, and the comment includes an `@` that is immediately followed by a username. If this is true, then label "true"; otherwise, label "false".

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006
Video name: Lec 3 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Comment: @michalchik it's the math dragon theorem
Task: Does the comment clarify someone's *math-related* misunderstanding or elaborate content from the video?
Label: true

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Video name: Lec 23: Flux; normal form of Green's theorem | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Comment: 30:00, the way to remember it is that the work is a straightforward dot product of F with <dx, dy>, M goes with x and N goes with y and we add, and the flux is a dot product of F with the same vector rotated pi/2 so N goes with x and a minus sign with few choices left for M. Auroux missed a nice opportunity at the beginning to clarify the sign convention for flux by foreshadowing the result for closed curves with + being from the inside, out. I'm not faulting anyone, I couldn't give a lecture on this and keep possession of both my hands when erasing blackboards operated by hazardous machines. If he loses his hands, he'll never erase anything again. Be careful out there, Denis, we don't want to lose a great teacher.

Comment: @KatherineRogers Actually, if a constant k=1/1m is used, then in the final formula for V you will end up with subtracting m^1 from m^2 which is apparently not correct.
