Given a user comment on YouTube from a math MIT OCW video, your task is to explain (after "Explanation:") and label (after "Label:") whether the comment asks a specific mathematical question and/or points out a mathematical mistake in the video. If it is true, then label "true"; otherwise, label "false".

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006
Video name: Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Comment: can't L'Hopital's rule be explained geometricly? what about the functions curves' tangancy ?
Task: Does the comment ask a specific mathematical question and/or points out a mathematical mistake in the video?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "can't L'Hopital's rule be explained geometricly?" asks a question about L'Hopital's rule which is an important mathematical concept in calculus. Therefore, the label is true. 
Label: true

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 14. Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
Comment: Just I have wondered. Are they student of MIT? Why are they so silent??????
Task: Does the comment ask a specific mathematical question and/or points out a mathematical mistake in the video?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "Just I have wondered." is not a question and does not point out a mistake in the video. "Are they student of MIT? Why are they so silent??????" are questions, but it is not related to mathematics. Therefore, the label is false.
Label: false

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.100A Real Analysis, Fall 2020
Video name: Lecture 7: Convergent Sequences of Real Numbers
Comment: There is a mistake in lecture notes, example 71. Example in the lecture notes picks epsilon_0=1/2 and then proceeds with 1=|(-1)^M-(-1)^(M+1)|. This is wrong. Epsilon should be 1; and the expression with absolute values evaluates to 2. The lecture video is correct, the lecture notes are not.
Task: Does the comment ask a specific mathematical question and/or points out a mathematical mistake in the video?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "There is a mistake in lecture notes, example 71." points out a mistake in the lecture notes. Therefore, the label is true.
Label: true
