Given a user comment on YouTube from a math MIT OCW video, your task is to explain (after "Explanation:") and label (after "Label:") whether the comment expresses a general sentiment/adjective about or expresses a *general/big-picture* opinion about the video's *content* and/or about the teaching/professional characteristics of the *instructor*. If it is true, then label "true"; otherwise, label "false".

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 34. Final Course Review
Comment: Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Task: Does the comment express a general opinion about the video's content and/or about the teaching/professional characteristics of the instructor?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "Absolutely well done and definitely keep it up!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍" expresses a general opinion about the video (well done). Therefore, the label is true.
Label: true

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Video name: Lec 3: Matrices; inverse matrices | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Comment: Ideally, do you learn multivariable calculus first or linear algebra? A lot of stuff here seems to be based on 18.06.
Task: Does the comment express a general opinion about the video's content and/or about the teaching/professional characteristics of the instructor?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "Ideally, do you learn multivariable calculus first or linear algebra?" asks a math-related question, and does not express a general opinion about the content or teaching of the instructor. "A lot of stuff here seems to be based on 18.06." builds on the math-related question. Therefore, the label is false.
Label: false
