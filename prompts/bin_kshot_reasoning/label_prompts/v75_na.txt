Given a user comment on YouTube from a math MIT OCW video, your task is to explain (after "Explanation:") and label (after "Label:") whether the comment expresses a joke or is a troll comment. If it is true, then label "true"; otherwise, label "false".

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Video name: Lec 1: Dot product | MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus, Fall 2007
Comment: Watching this to make me feel better about college algebra. lol
Task: Does the comment expresses a joke or is the comment a troll comment?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "Watching this to make me feel better about college algebra." does not seem to express a joke. "lol" expresses a joking tone to the comment. Therefore, the label is true.
