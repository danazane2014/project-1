Given a user comment on YouTube from a math MIT OCW video, your task is to explain (after "Explanation:") and label (after "Label:") whether the comment is in English. If it is true, then label "true"; otherwise, label "false".

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Comment: Amazing! I like linear algebra a lot, I already had this class in college, I keep reading about it and ... I didn't even notice the passing of 40 minutes of the first class you! No wonder MIT is a world reference!
Task: Is the comment in English?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find a sentence that is not in English. "Amazing!" is in English. "I like linear algebra a lot, I already had this class in college, I keep reading about it and ... I didn't even notice the passing of 40 minutes of the first class you!" is in English. "No wonder MIT is a world reference!" is also in English. The entire comment is in English. Therefore, the label is true.
Label: true

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006
Video name: Lec 35 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Comment: 이게 계속 쓰지 말라던 로피탈이구나
Task: Is the comment in English?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find a sentence that is not in English. "이게 계속 쓰지 말라던 로피탈이구나" is not in English. Therefore, the label is false. 
Label: false

Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 21. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Comment: Wish this guy taught me Math 293 and 294 at Cornell. My guy could barely speak English, let alone explain what we were trying to accomplish. I understood that if we wanted eigenvectors perpendicular to x we'd get lift relative to flow...but this guy would have made the math a bit simpler.
