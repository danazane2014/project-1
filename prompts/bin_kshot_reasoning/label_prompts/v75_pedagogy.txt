Given a user comment on YouTube from a math MIT OCW video, your task is to explain (after "Explanation:") and label (after "Label:") whether the comment explicitly mentions a pedagogical method, which includes but is not limited to the use of examples, applications, worked out problems, proofs, visualizations, elaboration, step-by-step explanation, reiteration, and analogies. If this is true, then label "true"; otherwise, label "false".

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 26. Complex Matrices; Fast Fourier Transform
Comment: He's just showing applications of linear algebra, not teaching them. That's why it seems "sloppy". You just can't teach Fourier Transform in 30 mins.
Task: Does the comment explicitly mention a pedagogical method?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "He's just showing applications of linear algebra, not teaching them." mentions the teacher is using applications. Applications are a pedagogical methods. Therefore, the label is true. 
Label: true

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 1. The Geometry of Linear Equations
Comment: This lecture plus 3blue1brown's videos are getting these concepts to stick for me. Thank you Prof. Strang!!!
Task: Does the comment explicitly mention a pedagogical method?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "This lecture plus 3blue1brown's videos are getting these concepts to stick for me." communicates that the video is helpful, but it does not mention any pedagogical method that makes the video helpful. "Thank you Prof. Strang!!!" does not mention any pedagogical method. Therefore, the label is false. 
Label: false

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2005
Video name: 9. Independence, Basis, and Dimension
Comment: His teaching style seems casual and intuitive. I go to a small public college and the course is much more formal and proof driven. These lectures are a great addition to (as well as a nice break from)  formal proofs. Thanks MIT!
Task: Does the comment explicitly mention a pedagogical method?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "His teaching style seems casual and intuitive." describes the teaching style, but does not mention what methods the instructor uses to enable for a casual and intuitive style. "I go to a small public college and the course is much more formal and proof driven." mentions the proofs from their previous course, which is a pedagogical method. Therefore, the label is true.
Label: true
