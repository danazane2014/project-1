Given a user comment on YouTube from a math MIT OCW video, your task is to explain (after "Explanation:") and label (after "Label:") whether the comment mentions the lecture’s physical teaching setup, which includes but is not limited to the chalk, board, microphone or audio-related aspects, and camera-related aspects (e.g., angle). If it is true, then label "true"; otherwise, label "false".

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.100A Real Analysis, Fall 2020
Video name: Lecture 1: Sets, Set Operations and Mathematical Induction
Comment: Thanks for posting this course, the instructor is great. If I may, there is only one request, in the future if the camera could move less frequently, the camera is following the instructor too closely, making me a bit dizzy.
Task: Does the comment mention the lecture’s physical teaching setup?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "Thanks for posting this course, the instructor is great." does not mention the lecture's physical teaching setup. "If I may, there is only one request, in the future if the camera could move less frequently, the camera is following the instructor too closely, making me a bit dizzy." mentions the camera, which is a part of the lecture's physical setup. Therefore, the label is true.
Label: true

Playlist name: 6.041 Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability
Video name: 5. Discrete Random Variables I
Comment: A ""random variable is a function in programming"".... mic drop!
Task: Does the comment mention the lecture’s physical teaching setup?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "A ""random variable is a function in programming"".... mic drop!" mentions a mic, but is used figuratively in this context. Therefore, the label is false. 
Label: false

Consider a YouTube comment from the math MIT OCW video below:
Playlist name: MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2006
Video name: Lec 30 | MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, Fall 2007
Comment: The mic noise and hiss is distracting in this lecture, I hope someone could fix it ..
Task: Does the comment mention the lecture’s physical teaching setup?
Explanation: Let's go through the sentences one by one until we find one that meets the criterion. "The mic noise and hiss is distracting in this lecture, I hope someone could fix it .." mentions the mic hissing, which is part of the physical teaching setup. Therefore, the label is true. 
Label: true
